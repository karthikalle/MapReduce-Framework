10	 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE SOCRATES who is the narrator CHARMIDES 
11	CHAEREPHON CRITIAS Scene The Palaestra of Taureas which is near
12	the Porch of the King Archon 
14	 Yesterday evening I returned from the army at Potidaea and having
15	been a good while away I thought that I should like to go and look at
16	my old haunts So I went into the palaestra of Taureas which is
17	over against the temple adjoining the porch of the King Archon and
18	there I found a number of persons most of whom I knew but not all 
19	My visit was unexpected and no sooner did they see me entering than
20	they saluted me from afar on all sides and Chaerephon who is a
21	kind of madman started up and ran to me seizing my hand and saying 
22	How did you escape Socrates I should explain that an engagement had
23	taken place at Potidaea not long before we came away of which the
24	news had only just reached Athens 
26	 You see I replied that here I am 
28	 There was a report he said that the engagement was very severe 
29	and that many of our acquaintance had fallen 
31	 That I replied was not far from the truth 
33	 I suppose he said that you were present 
35	 I was 
37	 Then sit down and tell us the whole story which as yet we have
38	only heard imperfectly 
40	 I took the place which he assigned to me by the side of Critias the
41	son of Callaeschrus and when I had saluted him and the rest of the
42	company I told them the news from the army and answered their
43	several enquiries 
45	 Then when there had been enough of this I in my turn began to
46	make enquiries about matters at home about the present state of
47	philosophy and about the youth I asked whether any of them were
48	remarkable for wisdom or beauty or both Critias glancing at the
49	door invited my attention to some youths who were coming in and
50	talking noisily to one another followed by a crowd Of the
51	beauties Socrates he said I fancy that you will soon be able to
52	form a judgment For those who are just entering are the advanced
53	guard of the great beauty as he is thought to be of the day and
54	he is likely to be not far off himself 
56	 Who is he I said and who is his father 
58	 Charmides he replied is his name he is my cousin and the son
59	of my uncle Glaucon I rather think that you know him too although he
60	was not grown up at the time of your departure 
62	 Certainly I know him I said for he was remarkable even then
63	when he was still a child and I should imagine that by this time he
64	must be almost a young man 
66	 You will see he said in a moment what progress he has made and
67	what he is like He had scarcely said the word when Charmides
68	entered 
70	 Now you know my friend that I cannot measure anything and of
71	the beautiful I am simply such a measure as a white line is of chalk 
72	for almost all young persons appear to be beautiful in my eyes But at
73	that moment when I saw him coming in I confess that I was quite
74	astonished at his beauty and stature all the world seemed to be
75	enamoured of him amazement and confusion reigned when he entered and
76	a troop of lovers followed him That grown up men like ourselves
77	should have been affected in this way was not surprising but I
78	observed that there was the same feeling among the boys all of
79	them down to the very least child turned and looked at him as if he
80	had been a statue 
82	 Chaerephon called me and said What do you think of him Socrates 
83	Has he not a beautiful face 
85	 Most beautiful I said 
87	 But you would think nothing of his face he replied if you could
88	see his naked form he is absolutely perfect 
90	 And to this they all agreed 
92	 By Heracles I said there never was such a paragon if he has
93	only one other slight addition 
95	 What is that said Critias 
97	 If he has a noble soul and being of your house Critias he may
98	be expected to have this 
100	 He is as fair and good within as he is without replied Critias 
102	 Then before we see his body should we not ask him to show us his
103	soul naked and undisguised he is just of an age at which he will
104	like to talk 
106	 That he will said Critias and I can tell you that he is a
107	philosopher already and also a considerable poet not in his own
108	opinion only but in that of others 
110	 That my dear Critias I replied is a distinction which has long
111	been in your family and is inherited by you from Solon But why do
112	you not call him and show him to us for even if he were younger than
113	he is there could be no impropriety in his talking to us in the
114	presence of you who are his guardian and cousin 
116	 Very well he said then I will call him and turning to the
117	attendant he said Call Charmides and tell him that I want him to
118	come and see a physician about the illness of which he spoke to me the
119	day before yesterday Then again addressing me he added He has
120	been complaining lately of having a headache when he rises in the
121	morning now why should you not make him believe that you know a
122	cure for the headache 
124	 Why not I said but will he come 
126	 He will be sure to come he replied 
128	 He came as he was bidden and sat down between Critias and me Great
129	amusement was occasioned by every one pushing with might and main at
130	his neighbour in order to make a place for him next to themselves 
131	until at the two ends of the row one had to get up and the other was
132	rolled over sideways Now my friend was beginning to feel awkward 
133	former bold belief in my powers of conversing with him had vanished 
134	And when Critias told him that I was the person who had the cure he
135	looked at me in such an indescribable manner and was just going to
136	ask a question And at that moment all the people in the palaestra
137	crowded about us and O rare I caught a sight of the inwards of
138	his garment and took the flame Then I could no longer contain
139	myself I thought how well Cydias understood the nature of love when 
140	in speaking of a fair youth he warns some one not to bring the
141	fawn in the sight of the lion to be devoured by him for I felt
142	that I had been overcome by a sort of wild beast appetite But I
143	controlled myself and when he asked me if I knew the cure of the
144	headache I answered but with an effort that I did know 
146	 And what is it he said 
148	 I replied that it was a kind of leaf which required to be
149	accompanied by a charm and if a person would repeat the charm at
150	the same time that he used the cure he would be made whole but
151	that without the charm the leaf would be of no avail 
153	 Then I will write out the charm from your dictation he said 
155	 With my consent I said or without my consent 
157	 With your consent Socrates he said laughing 
159	 Very good I said and are you quite sure that you know my name 
161	 I ought to know you he replied for there is a great deal said
162	about you among my companions and I remember when I was a child
163	seeing you in company with my cousin Critias 
165	 I am glad to find that you remember me I said for I shall now be
166	more at home with you and shall be better able to explain the nature
167	of the charm about which I felt a difficulty before For the charm
168	will do more Charmides than only cure the headache I dare say
169	that you have heard eminent physicians say to a patient who comes to
170	them with bad eyes that they cannot cure his eyes by themselves 
171	but that if his eyes are to be cured his head must be treated and
172	then again they say that to think of curing the head alone and not
173	the rest of the body also is the height of folly And arguing in this
174	way they apply their methods to the whole body and try to treat and
175	heal the whole and the part together Did you ever observe that this
176	is what they say 
178	 Yes he said 
180	 And they are right and you would agree with them 
182	 Yes he said certainly I should 
184	 His approving answers reassured me and I began by degrees to regain
185	confidence and the vital heat returned Such Charmides I said is
186	the nature of the charm which I learned when serving with the army
187	from one of the physicians of the Thracian king Zamolxis who are to
188	be so skilful that they can even give immortality This Thracian
189	told me that in these notions of theirs which I was just now
190	mentioning the Greek physicians are quite right as far as they go 
191	but Zamolxis he added our king who is also a god says further 
192	 that as you ought not to attempt to cure the eyes without the head 
193	or the head without the body so neither ought you to attempt to
194	cure the body without the soul and this he said is the reason why
195	the cure of many diseases is unknown to the physicians of Hellas 
196	because they are ignorant of the whole which ought to be studied
197	also for the part can never be well unless the whole is well For
198	all good and evil whether in the body or in human nature originates 
199	as he declared in the soul and overflows from thence as if from the
200	head into the eyes And therefore if the head and body are to be well 
201	you must begin by curing the soul that is the first thing And the
202	cure my dear youth has to be effected by the use of certain
203	charms and these charms are fair words and by them temperance is
204	implanted in the soul and where temperance is there health is
205	speedily imparted not only to the head but to the whole body And he
206	who taught me the cure and the charm at the same time added a
207	special direction Let no one he said persuade you to cure the
208	head until he has first given you his soul to be cured by the
209	charm For this he said is the great error of our day in the
210	treatment of the human body that physicians separate the soul from
211	the body And he added with emphasis at the same time making me
212	swear to his words Let no one however rich or noble or fair 
213	persuade you to give him the cure without the charm Now I have
214	sworn and I must keep my oath and therefore if you will allow me
215	to apply the Thracian charm first to your soul as the stranger
216	directed I will afterwards proceed to apply the cure to your head 
217	But if not I do not know what I am to do with you my dear Charmides 
219	 Critias when he heard this said The headache will be an
220	unexpected gain to my young relation if the pain in his head
221	compels him to improve his mind and I can tell you Socrates that
222	Charmides is not only pre eminent in beauty among his equals but also
223	in that quality which is given by the charm and this as you say 
224	is temperance 
226	 Yes I said 
228	 Then let me tell you that he is the most temperate of human
229	beings and for his age inferior to none in any quality 
231	 Yes I said Charmides and indeed I think that you ought to excel
232	others in all good qualities for if I am not mistaken there is no one
233	present who could easily point out two Athenian houses whose union
234	would be likely to produce a better or nobler scion than the two
235	from which you are sprung There is your father s house which is
236	descended from Critias the son of Dropidas whose family has been
237	commemorated in the panegyrical verses of Anacreon Solon and many
238	other poets as famous for beauty and virtue and all other high
239	fortune and your mother s house is equally distinguished for your
240	maternal uncle Pyrilampes is reputed never to have found his
241	equal in Persia at the court of the great king or on the continent
242	of Asia in all the places to which he went as ambassador for stature
243	and beauty that whole family is not a whit inferior to the other 
244	Having such ancestors you ought to be first in all things and 
245	sweet son of Glaucon your outward form is no dishonour to any of
246	them If to beauty you add temperance and if in other respects you
247	are what Critias declares you to be then dear Charmides blessed art
248	thou in being the son of thy mother And here lies the point for if 
249	as he declares you have this gift of temperance already and are
250	temperate enough in that case you have no need of any charms whether
251	of Zamolxis or of Abaris the Hyperborean and I may as well let you
252	have the cure of the head at once but if you have not yet acquired
253	this quality I must use the charm before I give you the medicine 
254	Please therefore to inform me whether you admit the truth of what
255	Critias has been saying have you or have you not this quality of
256	temperance 
258	 Charmides blushed and the blush heightened his beauty for
259	modesty is becoming in youth he then said very ingenuously that he
260	really could not at once answer either yes or no to the question
261	which I had asked For said he if I affirm that I am not
262	temperate that would be a strange thing for me to say of myself 
263	and also I should give the lie to Critias and many others who think
264	as he tells you that I am temperate but on the other hand if I say
265	that I am I shall have to praise myself which would be ill
266	manners and therefore I do not know how to answer you 
268	 I said to him That is a natural reply Charmides and I think
269	that you and I ought together to enquire whether you have this quality
270	about which I am asking or not and then you will not be compelled
271	to say what you do not like neither shall I be a rash practitioner of
272	medicine therefore if you please I will share the enquiry with you 
273	but I will not press you if you would rather not 
275	 There is nothing which I should like better he said and as far
276	as I am concerned you may proceed in the way which you think best 
278	 I think I said that I had better begin by asking you a question 
279	for if temperance abides in you you must have an opinion about her 
280	she must give some intimation of her nature and qualities which may
281	enable you to form a notion of her Is not that true 
283	 Yes he said that I think is true 
285	 You know your native language I said and therefore you must be
286	able to tell what you feel about this 
288	 Certainly he said 
290	 In order then that I may form a conjecture whether you have
291	temperance abiding in you or not tell me I said what in your
292	opinion is Temperance 
294	 At first he hesitated and was very unwilling to answer then he
295	said that he thought temperance was doing things orderly and
296	quietly such things for example as walking in the streets and
297	talking or anything else of that nature In a word he said I should
298	answer that in my opinion temperance is quietness 
300	 Are you right Charmides I said No doubt some would affirm that
301	the quiet are the temperate but let us see whether these words have
302	any meaning and first tell me whether you would not acknowledge
303	temperance to be of the class of the noble and good 
305	 Yes 
307	 But which is best when you are at the writing master s to write the
308	same letters quickly or quietly 
310	 Quickly 
312	 And to read quickly or slowly 
314	 Quickly again 
316	 And in playing the lyre or wrestling quickness or sharpness are
317	far better than quietness and slowness 
319	 Yes 
321	 And the same holds in boxing and in the pancratium 
323	 Certainly 
325	 And in leaping and running and in bodily exercises generally 
326	quickness and agility are good slowness and inactivity and
327	quietness are bad 
329	 That is evident 
331	 Then I said in all bodily actions not quietness but the greatest
332	agility and quickness is noblest and best 
334	 Yes certainly 
336	 And is temperance a good 
338	 Yes 
340	 Then in reference to the body not quietness but quickness will be
341	the higher degree of temperance if temperance is a good 
343	 True he said 
345	 And which I said is better facility in learning or difficulty
346	in learning 
348	 Facility 
350	 Yes I said and facility in learning is learning quickly and
351	difficulty in learning is learning quietly and slowly 
353	 True 
355	 And is it not better to teach another quickly and energetically 
356	rather than quietly and slowly 
358	 Yes 
360	 And which is better to call to mind and to remember quickly and
361	readily or quietly and slowly 
363	 The former 
365	 And is not shrewdness a quickness or cleverness of the soul and not
366	a quietness 
368	 True 
370	 And is it not best to understand what is said whether at the
371	writing master s or the music master s or anywhere else not as
372	quietly as possible but as quickly as possible 
374	 Yes 
376	 And in the searchings or deliberations of the soul not the
377	quietest as I imagine and he who with difficulty deliberates and
378	discovers is thought worthy of praise but he who does so most easily
379	and quickly 
381	 Quite true he said 
383	 And in all that concerns either body or soul swiftness and activity
384	are clearly better than slowness and quietness 
386	 Clearly they are 
388	 Then temperance is not quietness nor is the temperate life
389	quiet certainly not upon this view for the life which is temperate
390	is supposed to be the good And of two things one is true either
391	never or very seldom do the quiet actions in life appear to be
392	better than the quick and energetic ones or supposing that of the
393	nobler actions there are as many quiet as quick and vehement still 
394	even if we grant this temperance will not be acting quietly any
395	more than acting quickly and energetically either in walking or
396	talking or in anything else nor will the quiet life be more temperate
397	than the unquiet seeing that temperance is admitted by us to be a
398	good and noble thing and the quick have been shown to be as good as
399	the quiet 
401	 I think he said Socrates that you are right 
403	 Then once more Charmides I said fix your attention and look
404	within consider the effect which temperance has upon yourself and
405	the nature of that which has the effect Think over all this and 
406	like a brave youth tell me What is temperance 
408	 After a moment s pause in which he made a real manly effort to
409	think he said My opinion is Socrates that temperance makes a man
410	ashamed or modest and that temperance is the same as modesty 
412	 Very good I said and did you not admit just now that
413	temperance is noble 
415	 Yes certainly he said 
417	 And the temperate are also good 
419	 Yes 
421	 And can that be good which does not make men good 
423	 Certainly not 
425	 And you would infer that temperance is not only noble but also
426	good 
428	 That is my opinion 
430	 Well I said but surely you would agree with Homer when he says 
432	 Modesty is not good for a needy man 
434	 Yes he said I agree 
436	 Then I suppose that modesty is and is not good 
438	 Clearly 
440	 But temperance whose presence makes men only good and not bad 
441	is always good 
443	 That appears to me to be as you say 
445	 And the inference is that temperance cannot be modesty if temperance
446	is a good and if modesty is as much an evil as a good 
448	 All that Socrates appears to me to be true but I should like to
449	know what you think about another definition of temperance which I
450	just now remember to have heard from some one who said That
451	temperance is doing our own business Was he right who affirmed that 
453	 You monster I said this is what Critias or some philosopher has
454	told you 
456	 Some one else then said Critias for certainly I have not 
458	 But what matter said Charmides from whom I heard this 
460	 No matter at all I replied for the point is not who said the
461	words but whether they are true or not 
463	 There you are in the right Socrates he replied 
465	 To be sure I said yet I doubt whether we shall ever be able to
466	discover their truth or falsehood for they are a kind of riddle 
468	 What makes you think so he said 
470	 Because I said he who uttered them seems to me to have meant one
471	thing and said another Is the scribe for example to be regarded as
472	doing nothing when he reads or writes 
474	 I should rather think that he was doing something 
476	 And does the scribe write or read or teach you boys to write or
477	read your own names only or did you write your enemies names as
478	well as your own and your friends 
480	 As much one as the other 
482	 And was there anything meddling or intemperate in this 
484	 Certainly not 
486	 And yet if reading and writing are the same as doing you were doing
487	what was not your own business 
489	 But they are the same as doing 
491	 And the healing art my friend and building and weaving and doing
492	anything whatever which is done by art these all clearly come under
493	the head of doing 
495	 Certainly 
497	 And do you think that a state would be well ordered by a law which
498	compelled every man to weave and wash his own coat and make his own
499	shoes and his own flask and strigil and other implements on this
500	principle of every one doing and performing his own and abstaining
501	from what is not his own 
503	 I think not he said 
505	 But I said a temperate state will be a well ordered state 
507	 Of course he replied 
509	 Then temperance I said will not be doing one s own business not
510	at least in this way or doing things of this sort 
512	 Clearly not 
514	 Then as I was just now saying he who declared that temperance is a
515	man doing his own business had another and a hidden meaning for I
516	do not think that he could have been such a fool as to mean this 
517	Was he a fool who told you Charmides 
519	 Nay he replied I certainly thought him a very wise man 
521	 Then I am quite certain that he put forth his definition as a
522	riddle thinking that no one would know the meaning of the words
523	 doing his own business 
525	 I dare say he replied 
527	 And what is the meaning of a man doing his own business Can you
528	tell me 
530	 Indeed I cannot and I should not wonder if the man himself who
531	used this phrase did not understand what he was saying Whereupon he
532	laughed slyly and looked at Critias 
534	 Critias had long been showing uneasiness for he felt that he had
535	a reputation to maintain with Charmides and the rest of the company 
536	He had however hitherto managed to restrain himself but now he
537	could no longer forbear and I am convinced of the truth of the
538	suspicion which I entertained at the time that Charmides had heard
539	this answer about temperance from Critias And Charmides who did
540	not want to answer himself but to make Critias answer tried to
541	stir him up He went on pointing out that he had been refuted at
542	which Critias grew angry and appeared as I thought inclined to
543	quarrel with him just as a poet might quarrel with an actor who
544	spoiled his poems in repeating them so he looked hard at him and
545	said 
547	 Do you imagine Charmides that the author of this definition of
548	temperance did not understand the meaning of his own words because
549	you do not understand them 
551	 Why at his age I said most excellent Critias he can hardly be
552	expected to understand but you who are older and have studied 
553	may well be assumed to know the meaning of them and therefore if you
554	agree with him and accept his definition of temperance I would
555	much rather argue with you than with him about the truth or
556	falsehood of the definition 
558	 I entirely agree said Critias and accept the definition 
560	 Very good I said and now let me repeat my question Do you admit 
561	as I was just now saying that all craftsmen make or do something 
563	 I do 
565	 And do they make or do their own business only or that of others
566	also 
568	 They make or do that of others also 
570	 And are they temperate seeing that they make not for themselves
571	or their own business only 
573	 Why not he said 
575	 No objection on my part I said but there may be a difficulty on
576	his who proposes as a definition of temperance doing one s own
577	business and then says that there is no reason why those who do
578	the business of others should not be temperate 
580	 Nay said he did I ever acknowledge that those who do the
581	business of others are temperate I said those who make not those
582	who do 
584	 What I asked do you mean to say that doing and making are not
585	the same 
587	 No more he replied than making or working are the same thus
588	much I have learned from Hesiod who says that work is no
589	disgrace Now do you imagine that if he had meant by working and
590	doing such things as you were describing he would have said that
591	there was no disgrace in them for example in the manufacture of
592	shoes or in selling pickles or sitting for hire in a house of
593	ill fame That Socrates is not to be supposed but I conceive him to
594	have distinguished making from doing and work and while admitting
595	that the making anything might sometimes become a disgrace when the
596	employment was not honourable to have thought that work was never any
597	disgrace at all For things nobly and usefully made he called works 
598	and such makings he called workings and doings and he must be
599	supposed to have called such things only man s proper business and
600	what is hurtful not his business and in that sense Hesiod and any
601	other wise man may be reasonably supposed to call him wise who does
602	his own work 
604	 O Critias I said no sooner had you opened your mouth than I
605	pretty well knew that you would call that which is proper to a man 
606	and that which is his own good and that the markings of the good you
607	would call doings for I am no stranger to the endless distinctions
608	which Prodicus draws about names Now I have no objection to your
609	giving names any signification which you please if you will only tell
610	me what you mean by them Please then to begin again and be a
611	little plainer Do you mean that this doing or making or whatever
612	is the word which you would use of good actions is temperance 
614	 I do he said 
616	 Then not he who does evil but he who does good is temperate 
618	 Yes he said and you friend would agree 
620	 No matter whether I should or not just now not what I think but
621	what you are saying is the point at issue 
623	 Well he answered I mean to say that he who does evil and not
624	good is not temperate and that he is temperate who does good and
625	not evil for temperance I define in plain words to be the doing of
626	good actions 
628	 And you may be very likely right in what you are saying but I am
629	curious to know whether you imagine that temperate men are ignorant of
630	their own temperance 
632	 I do not think so he said 
634	 And yet were you not saying just now that craftsmen might be
635	temperate in doing another s work as well as in doing their own 
637	 I was he replied but what is your drift 
639	 I have no particular drift but I wish that you would tell me
640	whether a physician who cures a patient may do good to himself and
641	good to another also 
643	 I think that he may 
645	 And he who does so does his duty 
647	 Yes 
649	 And does not he who does his duty act temperately or wisely 
651	 Yes he acts wisely 
653	 But must the physician necessarily know when his treatment is likely
654	to prove beneficial and when not or must the craftsman necessarily
655	know when he is likely to be benefited and when not to be
656	benefited by the work which he is doing 
658	 I suppose not 
660	 Then I said he may sometimes do good or harm and not know what he
661	is himself doing and yet in doing good as you say he has done
662	temperately or wisely Was not that your statement 
664	 Yes 
666	 Then as would seem in doing good he may act wisely or
667	temperately and be wise or temperate but not know his own wisdom
668	or temperance 
670	 But that Socrates he said is impossible and therefore if this
671	is as you imply the necessary consequence of any of my previous
672	admissions I will withdraw them rather than admit that a man can
673	be temperate or wise who does not know himself and I am not ashamed
674	to confess that I was in error For self knowledge would certainly
675	be maintained by me to be the very essence of knowledge and in this I
676	agree with him who dedicated the inscription Know thyself at
677	Delphi That word if I am not mistaken is put there as a sort of
678	salutation which the god addresses to those who enter the temple as
679	much as to say that the ordinary salutation of Hail is not right 
680	and that the exhortation Be temperate would be a far better way
681	of saluting one another The notion of him who dedicated the
682	inscription was as I believe that the god speaks to those who
683	enter his temple not as men speak but when a worshipper enters the
684	first word which he hears is Be temperate This however like a
685	prophet he expresses in a sort of riddle for Know thyself and
686	 Be temperate are the same as I maintain and as the letters imply 
687	and yet they may be easily misunderstood and succeeding sages who
688	added Never too much or Give a pledge and evil is nigh at hand 
689	would appear to have so misunderstood them for they imagined that
690	 Know thyself was a piece of advice which the god gave and not
691	his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in and they
692	dedicated their own inscription under the idea that they too would
693	give equally useful pieces of advice Shall I tell you Socrates 
694	why I say all this My object is to leave the previous discussion
695	 in which I know not whether you or I are more right but at any
696	rate no clear result was attained and to raise a new one in which I
697	will attempt to prove if you deny that temperance is self knowledge 
699	 Yes I said Critias but you come to me as though I professed to
700	know about the questions which I ask and as though I could if I only
701	would agree with you Whereas the fact is that I enquire with you
702	into the truth of that which is advanced from time to time just
703	because I do not know and when I have enquired I will say whether
704	I agree with you or not Please then to allow me time to reflect 
706	 Reflect he said 
708	 I am reflecting I replied and discover that temperance or wisdom 
709	if implying a knowledge of anything must be a science and a
710	science of something 
712	 Yes he said the science of itself 
714	 Is not medicine I said the science of health 
716	 True 
718	 And suppose I said that I were asked by you what is the use or
719	effect of medicine which is this science of health I should answer
720	that medicine is of very great use in producing health which as
721	you will admit is an excellent effect 
723	 Granted 
725	 And if you were to ask me what is the result or effect of
726	architecture which is the science of building I should say houses 
727	and so of other arts which all have their different results Now I
728	want you Critias to answer a similar question about temperance or
729	wisdom which according to you is the science of itself Admitting
730	this view I ask of you what good work worthy of the name wise does
731	temperance or wisdom which is the science of itself effect Answer
732	me 
734	 That is not the true way of pursuing the enquiry Socrates he said 
735	for wisdom is not like the other sciences any more than they are like
736	one another but you proceed as if they were alike For tell me he
737	said what result is there of computation or geometry in the same
738	sense as a house is the result of building or a garment of weaving 
739	or any other work of any other art Can you show me any such result of
740	them You cannot 
742	 That is true I said but still each of these sciences has a subject
743	which is different from the science I can show you that the art of
744	computation has to do with odd and even numbers in their numerical
745	relations to themselves and to each other Is not that true 
747	 Yes he said 
749	 And the odd and even numbers are not the same with the art of
750	computation 
752	 They are not 
754	 The art of weighing again has to do with lighter and heavier 
755	but the art of weighing is one thing and the heavy and the light
756	another Do you admit that 
758	 Yes 
760	 Now I want to know what is that which is not wisdom and of
761	which wisdom is the science 
763	 You are just falling into the old error Socrates he said You come
764	asking in what wisdom or temperance differs from the other sciences 
765	and then you try to discover some respect in which they are alike but
766	they are not for all the other sciences are of something else and
767	not of themselves wisdom alone is a science of other sciences and of
768	itself And of this as I believe you are very well aware and that
769	you are only doing what you denied that you were doing just now 
770	trying to refute me instead of pursuing the argument 
772	 And what if I am How can you think that I have any other motive
773	in refuting you but what I should have in examining into myself which
774	motive would be just a fear of my unconsciously fancying that I knew
775	something of which I was ignorant And at this moment I pursue the
776	argument chiefly for my own sake and perhaps in some degree also
777	for the sake of my other friends For is not the discovery of things
778	as they truly are a good common to all mankind 
780	 Yes certainly Socrates he said 
782	 Then I said be cheerful sweet sir and give your opinion in
783	answer to the question which I asked never minding whether Critias or
784	Socrates is the person refuted attend only to the argument and see
785	what will come of the refutation 
787	 I think that you are right he replied and I will do as you say 
789	 Tell me then I said what you mean to affirm about wisdom 
791	 I mean to say that wisdom is the only science which is the science
792	of itself as well as of the other sciences 
794	 But the science of science I said will also be the science of
795	the absence of science 
797	 Very true he said 
799	 Then the wise or temperate man and he only will know himself 
800	and be able to examine what he knows or does not know and to see what
801	others know and think that they know and do really know and what they
802	do not know and fancy that they know when they do not No other
803	person will be able to do this And this is wisdom and temperance
804	and self knowledge for a man to know what he knows and what he does
805	not know That is your meaning 
807	 Yes he said 
809	 Now then I said making an offering of the third or last argument
810	to Zeus the Saviour let us begin again and ask in the first
811	place whether it is or is not possible for a person to know that he
812	knows and does not know what he knows and does not know and in the
813	second place whether if perfectly possible such knowledge is of any
814	use 
816	 That is what we have to consider he said 
818	 And here Critias I said I hope that you will find a way out of
819	a difficulty into which I have got myself Shall I tell you the nature
820	of the difficulty 
822	 By all means he replied 
824	 Does not what you have been saying if true amount to this that
825	there must be a single science which is wholly a science of itself and
826	of other sciences and that the same is also the science of the
827	absence of science 
829	 Yes 
831	 But consider how monstrous this proposition is my friend in any
832	parallel case the impossibility will be transparent to you 
834	 How is that and in what cases do you mean 
836	 In such cases as this Suppose that there is a kind of vision
837	which is not like ordinary vision but a vision of itself and of other
838	sorts of vision and of the defect of them which in seeing sees no
839	colour but only itself and other sorts of vision Do you think that
840	there is such a kind of vision 
842	 Certainly not 
844	 Or is there a kind of hearing which hears no sound at all but
845	only itself and other sorts of hearing or the defects of them 
847	 There is not 
849	 Or take all the senses can you imagine that there is any sense of
850	itself and of other senses but which is incapable of perceiving the
851	objects of the senses 
853	 I think not 
855	 Could there be any desire which is not the desire of any pleasure 
856	but of itself and of all other desires 
858	 Certainly not 
860	 Or can you imagine a wish which wishes for no good but only for
861	itself and all other wishes 
863	 I should answer No 
865	 Or would you say that there is a love which is not the love of
866	beauty but of itself and of other loves 
868	 I should not 
870	 Or did you ever know of a fear which fears itself or other fears 
871	but has no object of fear 
873	 I never did he said 
875	 Or of an opinion which is an opinion of itself and of other
876	opinions and which has no opinion on the subjects of opinion in
877	general 
879	 Certainly not 
881	 But surely we are assuming a science of this kind which having
882	no subject matter is a science of itself and of the other sciences 
884	 Yes that is what is affirmed 
886	 But how strange is this if it be indeed true must not however as
887	yet absolutely deny the possibility of such a science let us rather
888	consider the matter 
890	 You are quite right 
892	 Well then this science of which we are speaking is a science of
893	something and is of a nature to be a science of something 
895	 Yes 
897	 Just as that which is greater is of a nature to be greater than
898	something else 
900	 Yes 
902	 Which is less if the other is conceived to be greater 
904	 To be sure 
906	 And if we could find something which is at once greater than itself 
907	and greater than other great things but not greater than those things
908	in comparison of which the others are greater then that thing would
909	have the property of being greater and also less than itself 
911	 That Socrates he said is the inevitable inference 
913	 Or if there be a double which is double of itself and of other
914	doubles these will be halves for the double is relative to the half 
916	 That is true 
918	 And that which is greater than itself will also be less and that
919	which is heavier will also be lighter and that which is older will
920	also be younger and the same of other things that which has a nature
921	relative to self will retain also the nature of its object I mean
922	to say for example that hearing is as we say of sound or voice Is
923	that true 
925	 Yes 
927	 Then if hearing hears itself it must hear a voice for there is
928	no other way of hearing 
930	 Certainly 
932	 And sight also my excellent friend if it sees itself must see a
933	colour for sight cannot see that which has no colour 
935	 No 
937	 Do you remark Critias that in several of the examples which have
938	been recited the notion of a relation to self is altogether
939	inadmissible and in other cases hardly credible inadmissible for
940	example in the case of magnitudes numbers and the like 
942	 Very true 
944	 But in the case of hearing and sight or in the power of
945	self motion and the power of heat to burn this relation to self will
946	be regarded as incredible by some but perhaps not by others And some
947	great man my friend is wanted who will satisfactorily determine for
948	us whether there is nothing which has an inherent property of
949	relation to self or some things only and not others and whether in
950	this class of self related things if there be such a class that
951	science which is called wisdom or temperance is included I altogether
952	distrust my own power of determining these matters I am not certain
953	whether there is such a science of science at all and even if there
954	be I should not acknowledge this to be wisdom or temperance until
955	I can also see whether such a science would or would not do us any
956	good for I have an impression that temperance is a benefit and a
957	good And therefore O son of Callaeschrus as you maintain that
958	temperance or wisdom is a science of science and also of the
959	absence of science I will request you to show in the first place 
960	as I was saying before the possibility and in the second place 
961	the advantage of such a science and then perhaps you may satisfy
962	me that you are right in your view of temperance 
964	 Critias heard me say this and saw that I was in a difficulty and
965	as one person when another yawns in his presence catches the infection
966	of yawning from him so did he seem to be driven into a difficulty
967	by my difficulty But as he had a reputation to maintain he was
968	ashamed to admit before the company that he could not answer my
969	challenge or determine the question at issue and he made an
970	unintelligible attempt to hide his perplexity In order that the
971	argument might proceed I said to him Well then Critias if you like 
972	let us assume that there is this science of science whether the
973	assumption is right or wrong may hereafter be investigated 
974	Admitting the existence of it will you tell me how such a science
975	enables us to distinguish what we know or do not know which as we
976	were saying is self knowledge or wisdom so we were saying 
978	 Yes Socrates he said and that I think is certainly true for he
979	who has this science or knowledge which knows itself will become
980	like the knowledge which he has in the same way that he who has
981	swiftness will be swift and he who has beauty will be beautiful 
982	and he who has knowledge will know In the same way he who has that
983	knowledge which is self knowing will know himself 
985	 I do not doubt I said that a man will know himself when he
986	possesses that which has self knowledge but what necessity is there
987	that having this he should know what he knows and what he does not
988	know 
990	 Because Socrates they are the same 
992	 Very likely I said but I remain as stupid as ever for still I
993	fail to comprehend how this knowing what you know and do not know is
994	the same as the knowledge of self 
996	 What do you mean he said 
998	 This is what I mean I replied I will admit that there is a science
999	of science can this do more than determine that of two things one
1000	is and the other is not science or knowledge 
1002	 No just that 
1004	 But is knowledge or want of knowledge of health the same as
1005	knowledge or want of knowledge of justice 
1007	 Certainly not 
1009	 The one is medicine and the other is politics whereas that of
1010	which we are speaking is knowledge pure and simple 
1012	 Very true 
1014	 And if a man knows only and has only knowledge of knowledge and
1015	has no further knowledge of health and justice the probability is
1016	that he will only know that he knows something and has a certain
1017	knowledge whether concerning himself or other men 
1019	 True 
1021	 Then how will this knowledge or science teach him to know what he
1022	knows Say that he knows health not wisdom or temperance but the art
1023	of medicine has taught it to him and he has learned harmony from
1024	the art of music and building from the art of building neither from
1025	wisdom or temperance and the same of other things 
1027	 That is evident 
1029	 How will wisdom regarded only as a knowledge of knowledge or
1030	science of science ever teach him that he knows health or that he
1031	knows building 
1033	 It is impossible 
1035	 Then he who is ignorant of these things will only know that he
1036	knows but not what he knows 
1038	 True 
1040	 Then wisdom or being wise appears to be not the knowledge of the
1041	things which we do or do not know but only the knowledge that we know
1042	or do not know 
1044	 That is the inference 
1046	 Then he who has this knowledge will not be able to examine whether a
1047	pretender knows or does not know that which he says that he knows 
1048	he will only know that he has a knowledge of some kind but wisdom
1049	will not show him of what the knowledge is 
1051	 Plainly not 
1053	 Neither will he be able to distinguish the pretender in medicine
1054	from the true physician nor between any other true and false
1055	professor of knowledge Let us consider the matter in this way If the
1056	wise man or any other man wants to distinguish the true physician from
1057	the false how will he proceed He will not talk to him about
1058	medicine and that as we were saying is the only thing which the
1059	physician understands 
1061	 True 
1063	 And on the other hand the physician knows nothing of science 
1064	for this has been assumed to be the province of wisdom 
1066	 True 
1068	 And further since medicine is science we must infer that he does
1069	not know anything of medicine 
1071	 Exactly 
1073	 Then the wise man may indeed know that the physician has some kind
1074	of science or knowledge but when he wants to discover the nature of
1075	this he will ask What is the subject matter For the several sciences
1076	are distinguished not by the mere fact that they are sciences but
1077	by the nature of their subjects Is not that true 
1079	 Quite true 
1081	 And medicine is distinguished from other sciences as having the
1082	subject matter of health and disease 
1084	 Yes 
1086	 And he who would enquire into the nature of medicine must pursue the
1087	enquiry into health and disease and not into what is extraneous 
1089	 True 
1091	 And he who judges rightly will judge of the physician as a physician
1092	in what relates to these 
1094	 He will 
1096	 He will consider whether what he says is true and whether what he
1097	does is right in relation to health and disease 
1099	 He will 
1101	 But can any one attain the knowledge of either unless he have a of
1102	medicine 
1104	 He cannot 
1106	 No one at all it would seem except the physician can have this
1107	knowledge and therefore not the wise man he would have to be a
1108	physician as well as a wise man 
1110	 Very true 
1112	 Then assuredly wisdom or temperance if only a science of science 
1113	and of the absence of science or knowledge will not be able to
1114	distinguish the physician who knows from one who does not know but
1115	pretends or thinks that he knows or any other professor of anything
1116	at all like any other artist he will only know his fellow in art
1117	or wisdom and no one else 
1119	 That is evident he said 
1121	 But then what profit Critias I said is there any longer in wisdom
1122	or temperance which yet remains if this is wisdom If indeed as
1123	we were supposing at first the wise man had been able to
1124	distinguish what he knew and did not know and that he knew the one
1125	and did not know the other and to recognize a similar faculty of
1126	discernment in others there would certainly have been a great
1127	advantage in being wise for then we should never have made a mistake 
1128	but have passed through life the unerring guides of ourselves and of
1129	those who are under us and we should not have attempted to do what we
1130	did not know but we should have found out those who knew and have
1131	handed the business over to them and trusted in them nor should we
1132	have allowed those who were under us to do anything which they were
1133	not likely to do well and they would be likely to do well just that of
1134	which they had knowledge and the house or state which was ordered
1135	or administered under the guidance of wisdom and everything else of
1136	which wisdom was the lord would have been well ordered for truth
1137	guiding and error having been eliminated in all their doings men
1138	would have done well and would have been happy Was not this 
1139	Critias what we spoke of as the great advantage of wisdom to know
1140	what is known and what is unknown to us 
1142	 Very true he said 
1144	 And now you perceive I said that no such science is to be found
1145	anywhere 
1147	 I perceive he said 
1149	 May we assume then I said that wisdom viewed in this new light
1150	merely as a knowledge of knowledge and ignorance has this
1151	advantage that he who possesses such knowledge will more easily learn
1152	anything which he learns and that everything will be clearer to
1153	him because in addition to the knowledge of individuals he sees the
1154	science and this also will better enable him to test the knowledge
1155	which others have of what he knows himself whereas the enquirer who
1156	is without this knowledge may be supposed to have a feebler and weaker
1157	insight Are not these my friend the real advantages which are to be
1158	gained from wisdom And are not we looking and seeking after something
1159	more than is to be found in her 
1161	 That is very likely he said 
1163	 That is very likely I said and very likely too we have been
1164	enquiring to no purpose as I am led to infer because I observe
1165	that if this is wisdom some strange consequences would follow Let
1166	us if you please assume the possibility of this science of sciences 
1167	and further admit and allow as was originally suggested that
1168	wisdom is the knowledge of what we know and do not know Assuming
1169	all this still upon further consideration I am doubtful Critias 
1170	whether wisdom such as this would do us much good For we were
1171	wrong I think in supposing as we were saying just now that such
1172	wisdom ordering the government of house or state would be a great
1173	benefit 
1175	 How so he said 
1177	 Why I said we were far too ready to admit the great benefits which
1178	mankind would obtain from their severally doing the things which
1179	they knew and committing the things of which they are ignorant to
1180	those who were better acquainted with them 
1182	 Were we not right in making that admission 
1184	 I think not 
1186	 How very strange Socrates 
1188	 By the dog of Egypt I said there I agree with you and I was
1189	thinking as much just now when I said that strange consequences
1190	would follow and that I was afraid we were on the wrong track for
1191	however ready we may be to admit that this is wisdom I certainly
1192	cannot make out what good this sort of thing does to us 
1194	 What do you mean he said I wish that you could make me
1195	understand what you mean 
1197	 I dare say that what I am saying is nonsense I replied and yet
1198	if a man has any feeling of what is due to himself he cannot let
1199	the thought which comes into his mind pass away unheeded and
1200	unexamined 
1202	 I like that he said 
1204	 Hear then I said my own dream whether coming through the horn or
1205	the ivory gate I cannot tell The dream is this Let us suppose
1206	that wisdom is such as we are now defining and that she has
1207	absolute sway over us then each action will be done according to
1208	the arts or sciences and no one professing to be a pilot when he is
1209	not or any physician or general or any one else pretending to know
1210	matters of which he is ignorant will deceive or elude us our
1211	health will be improved our safety at sea and also in battle will
1212	be assured our coats and shoes and all other instruments and
1213	implements will be skilfully made because the workmen will be good
1214	and true Aye and if you please you may suppose that prophecy which
1215	is the knowledge of the future will be under the control of wisdom 
1216	and that she will deter deceivers and set up the true prophets in
1217	their place as the revealers of the future Now I quite agree that
1218	mankind thus provided would live and act according to knowledge for
1219	wisdom would watch and prevent ignorance from intruding on us But
1220	whether by acting according to knowledge we shall act well and be
1221	happy my dear Critias this is a point which we have not yet been
1222	able to determine 
1224	 Yet I think he replied that if you discard knowledge you will
1225	hardly find the crown of happiness in anything else 
1227	 But of what is this knowledge I said Just answer me that small
1228	question Do you mean a knowledge of shoemaking 
1230	 God forbid 
1232	 Or of working in brass 
1234	 Certainly not 
1236	 Or in wool or wood or anything of that sort 
1238	 No I do not 
1240	 Then I said we are giving up the doctrine that he who lives
1241	according to knowledge is happy for these live according to
1242	knowledge and yet they are not allowed by you to be happy but I
1243	think that you mean to confine happiness to particular individuals who
1244	live according to knowledge such for example as the prophet who 
1245	as I was saying knows the future Is it of him you are speaking or of
1246	some one else 
1248	 Yes I mean him but there are others as well 
1250	 Yes I said some one who knows the past and present as well as
1251	the future and is ignorant of nothing Let us suppose that there is
1252	such a person and if there is you will allow that he is the most
1253	knowing of all living men 
1255	 Certainly he is 
1257	 Yet I should like to know one thing more which of the different
1258	kinds of knowledge makes him happy or do all equally make him happy 
1260	 Not all equally he replied 
1262	 But which most tends to make him happy the knowledge of what
1263	past present or future thing May I infer this to be the knowledge
1264	of the game of draughts 
1266	 Nonsense about the game of draughts 
1268	 Or of computation 
1270	 No 
1272	 Or of health 
1274	 That is nearer the truth he said 
1276	 And that knowledge which is nearest of all I said is the knowledge
1277	of what 
1279	 The knowledge with which he discerns good and evil 
1281	 Monster I said you have been carrying me round in a circle and
1282	all this time hiding from me the fact that the life according to
1283	knowledge is not that which makes men act rightly and be happy not
1284	even if knowledge include all the sciences but one science only that
1285	of good and evil For let me ask you Critias whether if you take
1286	away this medicine will not equally give health and shoemaking
1287	equally produce shoes and the art of the weaver clothes whether
1288	the art of the pilot will not equally save our lives at sea and the
1289	art of the general in war 
1291	 Quite so 
1293	 And yet my dear Critias none of these things will be well or
1294	beneficially done if the science of the good be wanting 
1296	 True 
1298	 But that science is not wisdom or temperance but a science of human
1299	advantage not a science of other sciences or of ignorance but of
1300	good and evil and if this be of use then wisdom or temperance will
1301	not be of use 
1303	 And why he replied will not wisdom be of use For however much we
1304	assume that wisdom is a science of sciences and has a sway over other
1305	sciences surely she will have this particular science of the good
1306	under her control and in this way will benefit us 
1308	 And will wisdom give health I said is not this rather the effect
1309	of medicine Or does wisdom do the work any of the other arts do they
1310	not each of them do their own work Have we not long ago asseverated
1311	that wisdom is only the knowledge of knowledge and of ignorance and
1312	of nothing else 
1314	 That is obvious 
1316	 Then wisdom will not be the producer of health 
1318	 Certainly not 
1320	 The art of health is different 
1322	 Yes different 
1324	 Nor does wisdom give advantage my good friend for that again we
1325	have just now been attributing to another art 
1327	 Very true 
1329	 How then can wisdom be advantageous when giving no advantage 
1331	 That Socrates is certainly inconceivable 
1333	 You see then Critias that I was not far wrong in fearing that I
1334	could have no sound notion about wisdom I was quite right in
1335	depreciating myself for that which is admitted to be the best of
1336	all things would never have seemed to us useless if I had been good
1337	for anything at an enquiry But now I have been utterly defeated 
1338	and have failed to discover what that is to which the imposer of names
1339	gave this name of temperance or wisdom And yet many more admissions
1340	were made by us than could be fairly granted for we admitted that
1341	there was a science of science although the argument said No and
1342	protested against us and we admitted further that this science
1343	knew the works of the other sciences although this too was denied
1344	by the argument because we wanted to show that the wise man had
1345	knowledge of what he knew and did not know also we nobly disregarded 
1346	and never even considered the impossibility of a man knowing in a
1347	sort of way that which he does not know at all for our assumption
1348	was that he knows that which he does not know than which nothing as
1349	I think can be more irrational And yet after finding us so easy and
1350	good natured the enquiry is still unable to discover the truth but
1351	mocks us to a degree and has gone out of its way to prove the
1352	inutility of that which we admitted only by a sort of supposition
1353	and fiction to be the true definition of temperance or wisdom which
1354	result as far as I am concerned is not so much to be lamented I
1355	said But for your sake Charmides I am very sorry that you having
1356	such beauty and such wisdom and temperance of soul should have no
1357	profit or good in life from your wisdom and temperance And still more
1358	am I grieved about the charm which I learned with so much pain and to
1359	so little profit from the Thracian for the sake of a thing which
1360	is nothing worth I think indeed that there is a mistake and that I
1361	must be a bad enquirer for wisdom or temperance I believe to be
1362	really a great good and happy are you Charmides if you certainly
1363	possess it Wherefore examine yourself and see whether you have
1364	this gift and can do without the charm for if you can I would rather
1365	advise you to regard me simply as a fool who is never able to reason
1366	out anything and to rest assured that the more wise and temperate you
1367	are the happier you will be 
1369	 Charmides said I am sure that I do not know Socrates whether I
1370	have or have not this gift of wisdom and temperance for how can I
1371	know whether I have a thing of which even you and Critias are as you
1372	say unable to discover the nature not that I believe you And
1373	further I am sure Socrates that I do need the charm and as far
1374	as I am concerned I shall be willing to be charmed by you daily 
1375	until you say that I have had enough 
1377	 Very good Charmides said Critias if you do this I shall have a
1378	proof of your temperance that is if you allow yourself to be charmed
1379	by Socrates and never desert him at all 
1381	 You may depend on my following and not deserting him said
1382	Charmides if you who are my guardian command me I should be very
1383	wrong not to obey you 
1385	 And I do command you he said 
1387	 Then I will do as you say and begin this very day 
1389	 You sirs I said what are you conspiring about 
1391	 We are not conspiring said Charmides we have conspired already 
1393	 And are you about to use violence without even going through the
1394	forms of justice 
1396	 Yes I shall use violence he replied since he orders me and
1397	therefore you had better consider well 
1399	 But the time for consideration has passed I said when violence
1400	is employed and you when you are determined on anything and in
1401	the mood of violence are irresistible 
1403	 Do not you resist me then he said 
1405	 I will not resist you I replied 
1407	 THE END
