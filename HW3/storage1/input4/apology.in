9	INTRODUCTION 
11	In what relation the Apology of Plato stands to the real defence of
12	Socrates there are no means of determining It certainly agrees in tone
13	and character with the description of Xenophon who says in the Memorabilia
14	that Socrates might have been acquitted if in any moderate degree he would
15	have conciliated the favour of the dicasts and who informs us in another
16	passage on the testimony of Hermogenes the friend of Socrates that he
17	had no wish to live and that the divine sign refused to allow him to
18	prepare a defence and also that Socrates himself declared this to be
19	unnecessary on the ground that all his life long he had been preparing
20	against that hour For the speech breathes throughout a spirit of
21	defiance ut non supplex aut reus sed magister aut dominus videretur esse
22	judicum Cic de Orat and the loose and desultory style is an imitation
23	of the accustomed manner in which Socrates spoke in the agora and among
24	the tables of the money changers The allusion in the Crito may perhaps 
25	be adduced as a further evidence of the literal accuracy of some parts 
26	But in the main it must be regarded as the ideal of Socrates according to
27	Plato s conception of him appearing in the greatest and most public scene
28	of his life and in the height of his triumph when he is weakest and yet
29	his mastery over mankind is greatest and his habitual irony acquires a new
30	meaning and a sort of tragic pathos in the face of death The facts of his
31	life are summed up and the features of his character are brought out as if
32	by accident in the course of the defence The conversational manner the
33	seeming want of arrangement the ironical simplicity are found to result
34	in a perfect work of art which is the portrait of Socrates 
36	Yet some of the topics may have been actually used by Socrates and the
37	recollection of his very words may have rung in the ears of his disciple 
38	The Apology of Plato may be compared generally with those speeches of
39	Thucydides in which he has embodied his conception of the lofty character
40	and policy of the great Pericles and which at the same time furnish a
41	commentary on the situation of affairs from the point of view of the
42	historian So in the Apology there is an ideal rather than a literal
43	truth much is said which was not said and is only Plato s view of the
44	situation Plato was not like Xenophon a chronicler of facts he does
45	not appear in any of his writings to have aimed at literal accuracy He is
46	not therefore to be supplemented from the Memorabilia and Symposium of
47	Xenophon who belongs to an entirely different class of writers The
48	Apology of Plato is not the report of what Socrates said but an elaborate
49	composition quite as much so in fact as one of the Dialogues And we may
50	perhaps even indulge in the fancy that the actual defence of Socrates was
51	as much greater than the Platonic defence as the master was greater than
52	the disciple But in any case some of the words used by him must have
53	been remembered and some of the facts recorded must have actually
54	occurred It is significant that Plato is said to have been present at the
55	defence Apol as he is also said to have been absent at the last scene
56	in the Phaedo Is it fanciful to suppose that he meant to give the stamp
57	of authenticity to the one and not to the other especially when we
58	consider that these two passages are the only ones in which Plato makes
59	mention of himself The circumstance that Plato was to be one of his
60	sureties for the payment of the fine which he proposed has the appearance
61	of truth More suspicious is the statement that Socrates received the
62	first impulse to his favourite calling of cross examining the world from
63	the Oracle of Delphi for he must already have been famous before
64	Chaerephon went to consult the Oracle Riddell and the story is of a kind
65	which is very likely to have been invented On the whole we arrive at the
66	conclusion that the Apology is true to the character of Socrates but we
67	cannot show that any single sentence in it was actually spoken by him It
68	breathes the spirit of Socrates but has been cast anew in the mould of
69	Plato 
71	There is not much in the other Dialogues which can be compared with the
72	Apology The same recollection of his master may have been present to the
73	mind of Plato when depicting the sufferings of the Just in the Republic 
74	The Crito may also be regarded as a sort of appendage to the Apology in
75	which Socrates who has defied the judges is nevertheless represented as
76	scrupulously obedient to the laws The idealization of the sufferer is
77	carried still further in the Gorgias in which the thesis is maintained 
78	that to suffer is better than to do evil and the art of rhetoric is
79	described as only useful for the purpose of self accusation The
80	parallelisms which occur in the so called Apology of Xenophon are not worth
81	noticing because the writing in which they are contained is manifestly
82	spurious The statements of the Memorabilia respecting the trial and death
83	of Socrates agree generally with Plato but they have lost the flavour of
84	Socratic irony in the narrative of Xenophon 
86	The Apology or Platonic defence of Socrates is divided into three parts 
87	1st The defence properly so called 2nd The shorter address in mitigation
88	of the penalty 3rd The last words of prophetic rebuke and exhortation 
90	The first part commences with an apology for his colloquial style he is 
91	as he has always been the enemy of rhetoric and knows of no rhetoric but
92	truth he will not falsify his character by making a speech Then he
93	proceeds to divide his accusers into two classes first there is the
94	nameless accuser public opinion All the world from their earliest years
95	had heard that he was a corrupter of youth and had seen him caricatured in
96	the Clouds of Aristophanes Secondly there are the professed accusers 
97	who are but the mouth piece of the others The accusations of both might
98	be summed up in a formula The first say Socrates is an evil doer and a
99	curious person searching into things under the earth and above the heaven 
100	and making the worse appear the better cause and teaching all this to
101	others The second Socrates is an evil doer and corrupter of the youth 
102	who does not receive the gods whom the state receives but introduces other
103	new divinities These last words appear to have been the actual
104	indictment compare Xen Mem and the previous formula which is a
105	summary of public opinion assumes the same legal style 
107	The answer begins by clearing up a confusion In the representations of
108	the Comic poets and in the opinion of the multitude he had been
109	identified with the teachers of physical science and with the Sophists 
110	But this was an error For both of them he professes a respect in the open
111	court which contrasts with his manner of speaking about them in other
112	places Compare for Anaxagoras Phaedo Laws for the Sophists Meno 
113	Republic Tim Theaet Soph etc But at the same time he shows that
114	he is not one of them Of natural philosophy he knows nothing not that he
115	despises such pursuits but the fact is that he is ignorant of them and
116	never says a word about them Nor is he paid for giving instruction that
117	is another mistaken notion he has nothing to teach But he commends
118	Evenus for teaching virtue at such a moderate rate as five minae 
119	Something of the accustomed irony which may perhaps be expected to sleep
120	in the ear of the multitude is lurking here 
122	He then goes on to explain the reason why he is in such an evil name That
123	had arisen out of a peculiar mission which he had taken upon himself The
124	enthusiastic Chaerephon probably in anticipation of the answer which he
125	received had gone to Delphi and asked the oracle if there was any man
126	wiser than Socrates and the answer was that there was no man wiser What
127	could be the meaning of this that he who knew nothing and knew that he
128	knew nothing should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men 
129	Reflecting upon the answer he determined to refute it by finding a
130	wiser and first he went to the politicians and then to the poets and
131	then to the craftsmen but always with the same result he found that they
132	knew nothing or hardly anything more than himself and that the little
133	advantage which in some cases they possessed was more than counter balanced
134	by their conceit of knowledge He knew nothing and knew that he knew
135	nothing they knew little or nothing and imagined that they knew all
136	things Thus he had passed his life as a sort of missionary in detecting
137	the pretended wisdom of mankind and this occupation had quite absorbed him
138	and taken him away both from public and private affairs Young men of the
139	richer sort had made a pastime of the same pursuit which was not
140	unamusing And hence bitter enmities had arisen the professors of
141	knowledge had revenged themselves by calling him a villainous corrupter of
142	youth and by repeating the commonplaces about atheism and materialism and
143	sophistry which are the stock accusations against all philosophers when
144	there is nothing else to be said of them 
146	The second accusation he meets by interrogating Meletus who is present and
147	can be interrogated If he is the corrupter who is the improver of the
148	citizens Compare Meno All men everywhere But how absurd how
149	contrary to analogy is this How inconceivable too that he should make
150	the citizens worse when he has to live with them This surely cannot be
151	intentional and if unintentional he ought to have been instructed by
152	Meletus and not accused in the court 
154	But there is another part of the indictment which says that he teaches men
155	not to receive the gods whom the city receives and has other new gods 
156	 Is that the way in which he is supposed to corrupt the youth Yes it
157	is Has he only new gods or none at all None at all What not
158	even the sun and moon No why he says that the sun is a stone and the
159	moon earth That replies Socrates is the old confusion about
160	Anaxagoras the Athenian people are not so ignorant as to attribute to the
161	influence of Socrates notions which have found their way into the drama 
162	and may be learned at the theatre Socrates undertakes to show that
163	Meletus rather unjustifiably has been compounding a riddle in this part
164	of the indictment There are no gods but Socrates believes in the
165	existence of the sons of gods which is absurd 
167	Leaving Meletus who has had enough words spent upon him he returns to the
168	original accusation The question may be asked Why will he persist in
169	following a profession which leads him to death Why because he must
170	remain at his post where the god has placed him as he remained at
171	Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium where the generals placed him 
172	Besides he is not so overwise as to imagine that he knows whether death is
173	a good or an evil and he is certain that desertion of his duty is an evil 
174	Anytus is quite right in saying that they should never have indicted him if
175	they meant to let him go For he will certainly obey God rather than man 
176	and will continue to preach to all men of all ages the necessity of virtue
177	and improvement and if they refuse to listen to him he will still
178	persevere and reprove them This is his way of corrupting the youth which
179	he will not cease to follow in obedience to the god even if a thousand
180	deaths await him 
182	He is desirous that they should let him live not for his own sake but for
183	theirs because he is their heaven sent friend and they will never have
184	such another or as he may be ludicrously described he is the gadfly who
185	stirs the generous steed into motion Why then has he never taken part in
186	public affairs Because the familiar divine voice has hindered him if he
187	had been a public man and had fought for the right as he would certainly
188	have fought against the many he would not have lived and could therefore
189	have done no good Twice in public matters he has risked his life for the
190	sake of justice once at the trial of the generals and again in resistance
191	to the tyrannical commands of the Thirty 
193	But though not a public man he has passed his days in instructing the
194	citizens without fee or reward this was his mission Whether his
195	disciples have turned out well or ill he cannot justly be charged with the
196	result for he never promised to teach them anything They might come if
197	they liked and they might stay away if they liked and they did come 
198	because they found an amusement in hearing the pretenders to wisdom
199	detected If they have been corrupted their elder relatives if not
200	themselves might surely come into court and witness against him and there
201	is an opportunity still for them to appear But their fathers and brothers
202	all appear in court including this Plato to witness on his behalf and
203	if their relatives are corrupted at least they are uncorrupted and they
204	are my witnesses For they know that I am speaking the truth and that
205	Meletus is lying 
207	This is about all that he has to say He will not entreat the judges to
208	spare his life neither will he present a spectacle of weeping children 
209	although he too is not made of rock or oak Some of the judges
210	themselves may have complied with this practice on similar occasions and
211	he trusts that they will not be angry with him for not following their
212	example But he feels that such conduct brings discredit on the name of
213	Athens he feels too that the judge has sworn not to give away justice 
214	and he cannot be guilty of the impiety of asking the judge to break his
215	oath when he is himself being tried for impiety 
217	As he expected and probably intended he is convicted And now the tone
218	of the speech instead of being more conciliatory becomes more lofty and
219	commanding Anytus proposes death as the penalty and what counter 
220	proposition shall he make He the benefactor of the Athenian people 
221	whose whole life has been spent in doing them good should at least have
222	the Olympic victor s reward of maintenance in the Prytaneum Or why should
223	he propose any counter penalty when he does not know whether death which
224	Anytus proposes is a good or an evil And he is certain that imprisonment
225	is an evil exile is an evil Loss of money might be an evil but then he
226	has none to give perhaps he can make up a mina Let that be the penalty 
227	or if his friends wish thirty minae for which they will be excellent
228	securities 
230	 He is condemned to death 
232	He is an old man already and the Athenians will gain nothing but disgrace
233	by depriving him of a few years of life Perhaps he could have escaped if
234	he had chosen to throw down his arms and entreat for his life But he does
235	not at all repent of the manner of his defence he would rather die in his
236	own fashion than live in theirs For the penalty of unrighteousness is
237	swifter than death that penalty has already overtaken his accusers as
238	death will soon overtake him 
240	And now as one who is about to die he will prophesy to them They have
241	put him to death in order to escape the necessity of giving an account of
242	their lives But his death will be the seed of many disciples who will
243	convince them of their evil ways and will come forth to reprove them in
244	harsher terms because they are younger and more inconsiderate 
246	He would like to say a few words while there is time to those who would
247	have acquitted him He wishes them to know that the divine sign never
248	interrupted him in the course of his defence the reason of which as he
249	conjectures is that the death to which he is going is a good and not an
250	evil For either death is a long sleep the best of sleeps or a journey
251	to another world in which the souls of the dead are gathered together and
252	in which there may be a hope of seeing the heroes of old in which too 
253	there are just judges and as all are immortal there can be no fear of any
254	one suffering death for his opinions 
256	Nothing evil can happen to the good man either in life or death and his
257	own death has been permitted by the gods because it was better for him to
258	depart and therefore he forgives his judges because they have done him no
259	harm although they never meant to do him any good 
261	He has a last request to make to them that they will trouble his sons as
262	he has troubled them if they appear to prefer riches to virtue or to
263	think themselves something when they are nothing 
265	 
267	 Few persons will be found to wish that Socrates should have defended
268	himself otherwise if as we must add his defence was that with which
269	Plato has provided him But leaving this question which does not admit of
270	a precise solution we may go on to ask what was the impression which Plato
271	in the Apology intended to give of the character and conduct of his master
272	in the last great scene Did he intend to represent him 1 as employing
273	sophistries 2 as designedly irritating the judges Or are these
274	sophistries to be regarded as belonging to the age in which he lived and to
275	his personal character and this apparent haughtiness as flowing from the
276	natural elevation of his position 
278	For example when he says that it is absurd to suppose that one man is the
279	corrupter and all the rest of the world the improvers of the youth or 
280	when he argues that he never could have corrupted the men with whom he had
281	to live or when he proves his belief in the gods because he believes in
282	the sons of gods is he serious or jesting It may be observed that these
283	sophisms all occur in his cross examination of Meletus who is easily
284	foiled and mastered in the hands of the great dialectician Perhaps he
285	regarded these answers as good enough for his accuser of whom he makes
286	very light Also there is a touch of irony in them which takes them out
287	of the category of sophistry Compare Euthyph 
289	That the manner in which he defends himself about the lives of his
290	disciples is not satisfactory can hardly be denied Fresh in the memory
291	of the Athenians and detestable as they deserved to be to the newly
292	restored democracy were the names of Alcibiades Critias Charmides It
293	is obviously not a sufficient answer that Socrates had never professed to
294	teach them anything and is therefore not justly chargeable with their
295	crimes Yet the defence when taken out of this ironical form is
296	doubtless sound that his teaching had nothing to do with their evil
297	lives Here then the sophistry is rather in form than in substance 
298	though we might desire that to such a serious charge Socrates had given a
299	more serious answer 
301	Truly characteristic of Socrates is another point in his answer which may
302	also be regarded as sophistical He says that if he has corrupted the
303	youth he must have corrupted them involuntarily But if as Socrates
304	argues all evil is involuntary then all criminals ought to be admonished
305	and not punished In these words the Socratic doctrine of the
306	involuntariness of evil is clearly intended to be conveyed Here again as
307	in the former instance the defence of Socrates is untrue practically but
308	may be true in some ideal or transcendental sense The commonplace reply 
309	that if he had been guilty of corrupting the youth their relations would
310	surely have witnessed against him with which he concludes this part of his
311	defence is more satisfactory 
313	Again when Socrates argues that he must believe in the gods because he
314	believes in the sons of gods we must remember that this is a refutation
315	not of the original indictment which is consistent enough Socrates does
316	not receive the gods whom the city receives and has other new divinities 
317	 but of the interpretation put upon the words by Meletus who has affirmed
318	that he is a downright atheist To this Socrates fairly answers in
319	accordance with the ideas of the time that a downright atheist cannot
320	believe in the sons of gods or in divine things The notion that demons or
321	lesser divinities are the sons of gods is not to be regarded as ironical or
322	sceptical He is arguing ad hominem according to the notions of
323	mythology current in his age Yet he abstains from saying that he believed
324	in the gods whom the State approved He does not defend himself as
325	Xenophon has defended him by appealing to his practice of religion 
326	Probably he neither wholly believed nor disbelieved in the existence of
327	the popular gods he had no means of knowing about them According to
328	Plato compare Phaedo Symp as well as Xenophon Memor he was
329	punctual in the performance of the least religious duties and he must have
330	believed in his own oracular sign of which he seemed to have an internal
331	witness But the existence of Apollo or Zeus or the other gods whom the
332	State approves would have appeared to him both uncertain and unimportant
333	in comparison of the duty of self examination and of those principles of
334	truth and right which he deemed to be the foundation of religion Compare
335	Phaedr Euthyph Republic 
337	The second question whether Plato meant to represent Socrates as braving
338	or irritating his judges must also be answered in the negative His
339	irony his superiority his audacity regarding not the person of man 
340	necessarily flow out of the loftiness of his situation He is not acting a
341	part upon a great occasion but he is what he has been all his life long 
342	 a king of men He would rather not appear insolent if he could avoid it
343	 ouch os authadizomenos touto lego Neither is he desirous of hastening
344	his own end for life and death are simply indifferent to him But such a
345	defence as would be acceptable to his judges and might procure an
346	acquittal it is not in his nature to make He will not say or do anything
347	that might pervert the course of justice he cannot have his tongue bound
348	even in the throat of death With his accusers he will only fence and
349	play as he had fenced with other improvers of youth answering the
350	Sophist according to his sophistry all his life long He is serious when
351	he is speaking of his own mission which seems to distinguish him from all
352	other reformers of mankind and originates in an accident The dedication
353	of himself to the improvement of his fellow citizens is not so remarkable
354	as the ironical spirit in which he goes about doing good only in
355	vindication of the credit of the oracle and in the vain hope of finding a
356	wiser man than himself Yet this singular and almost accidental character
357	of his mission agrees with the divine sign which according to our notions 
358	is equally accidental and irrational and is nevertheless accepted by him
359	as the guiding principle of his life Socrates is nowhere represented to
360	us as a freethinker or sceptic There is no reason to doubt his sincerity
361	when he speculates on the possibility of seeing and knowing the heroes of
362	the Trojan war in another world On the other hand his hope of
363	immortality is uncertain he also conceives of death as a long sleep in
364	this respect differing from the Phaedo and at last falls back on
365	resignation to the divine will and the certainty that no evil can happen
366	to the good man either in life or death His absolute truthfulness seems
367	to hinder him from asserting positively more than this and he makes no
368	attempt to veil his ignorance in mythology and figures of speech The
369	gentleness of the first part of the speech contrasts with the aggravated 
370	almost threatening tone of the conclusion He characteristically remarks
371	that he will not speak as a rhetorician that is to say he will not make a
372	regular defence such as Lysias or one of the orators might have composed
373	for him or according to some accounts did compose for him But he first
374	procures himself a hearing by conciliatory words He does not attack the
375	Sophists for they were open to the same charges as himself they were
376	equally ridiculed by the Comic poets and almost equally hateful to Anytus
377	and Meletus Yet incidentally the antagonism between Socrates and the
378	Sophists is allowed to appear He is poor and they are rich his
379	profession that he teaches nothing is opposed to their readiness to teach
380	all things his talking in the marketplace to their private instructions 
381	his tarry at home life to their wandering from city to city The tone
382	which he assumes towards them is one of real friendliness but also of
383	concealed irony Towards Anaxagoras who had disappointed him in his hopes
384	of learning about mind and nature he shows a less kindly feeling which is
385	also the feeling of Plato in other passages Laws But Anaxagoras had
386	been dead thirty years and was beyond the reach of persecution 
388	It has been remarked that the prophecy of a new generation of teachers who
389	would rebuke and exhort the Athenian people in harsher and more violent
390	terms was as far as we know never fulfilled No inference can be drawn
391	from this circumstance as to the probability of the words attributed to him
392	having been actually uttered They express the aspiration of the first
393	martyr of philosophy that he would leave behind him many followers 
394	accompanied by the not unnatural feeling that they would be fiercer and
395	more inconsiderate in their words when emancipated from his control 
397	The above remarks must be understood as applying with any degree of
398	certainty to the Platonic Socrates only For although these or similar
399	words may have been spoken by Socrates himself we cannot exclude the
400	possibility that like so much else e g the wisdom of Critias the poem
401	of Solon the virtues of Charmides they may have been due only to the
402	imagination of Plato The arguments of those who maintain that the Apology
403	was composed during the process resting on no evidence do not require a
404	serious refutation Nor are the reasonings of Schleiermacher who argues
405	that the Platonic defence is an exact or nearly exact reproduction of the
406	words of Socrates partly because Plato would not have been guilty of the
407	impiety of altering them and also because many points of the defence might
408	have been improved and strengthened at all more conclusive See English
409	Translation What effect the death of Socrates produced on the mind of
410	Plato we cannot certainly determine nor can we say how he would or must
411	have written under the circumstances We observe that the enmity of
412	Aristophanes to Socrates does not prevent Plato from introducing them
413	together in the Symposium engaged in friendly intercourse Nor is there
414	any trace in the Dialogues of an attempt to make Anytus or Meletus
415	personally odious in the eyes of the Athenian public 
418	APOLOGY
420	by
422	Plato
424	Translated by Benjamin Jowett
427	How you O Athenians have been affected by my accusers I cannot tell but
428	I know that they almost made me forget who I was so persuasively did they
429	speak and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth But of the many
430	falsehoods told by them there was one which quite amazed me I mean when
431	they said that you should be upon your guard and not allow yourselves to be
432	deceived by the force of my eloquence To say this when they were certain
433	to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved myself to be anything
434	but a great speaker did indeed appear to me most shameless unless by the
435	force of eloquence they mean the force of truth for is such is their
436	meaning I admit that I am eloquent But in how different a way from
437	theirs Well as I was saying they have scarcely spoken the truth at all 
438	but from me you shall hear the whole truth not however delivered after
439	their manner in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases No 
440	by heaven but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the
441	moment for I am confident in the justice of my cause Or I am certain
442	that I am right in taking this course at my time of life I ought not to
443	be appearing before you O men of Athens in the character of a juvenile
444	orator let no one expect it of me And I must beg of you to grant me a
445	favour If I defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me using
446	the words which I have been in the habit of using in the agora at the
447	tables of the money changers or anywhere else I would ask you not to be
448	surprised and not to interrupt me on this account For I am more than
449	seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a court of
450	law I am quite a stranger to the language of the place and therefore I
451	would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger whom you would
452	excuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his
453	country Am I making an unfair request of you Never mind the manner 
454	which may or may not be good but think only of the truth of my words and
455	give heed to that let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide
456	justly 
458	And first I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers 
459	and then I will go on to the later ones For of old I have had many
460	accusers who have accused me falsely to you during many years and I am
461	more afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates who are dangerous 
462	too in their own way But far more dangerous are the others who began
463	when you were children and took possession of your minds with their
464	falsehoods telling of one Socrates a wise man who speculated about the
465	heaven above and searched into the earth beneath and made the worse
466	appear the better cause The disseminators of this tale are the accusers
467	whom I dread for their hearers are apt to fancy that such enquirers do not
468	believe in the existence of the gods And they are many and their charges
469	against me are of ancient date and they were made by them in the days when
470	you were more impressible than you are now in childhood or it may have
471	been in youth and the cause when heard went by default for there was none
472	to answer And hardest of all I do not know and cannot tell the names of
473	my accusers unless in the chance case of a Comic poet All who from envy
474	and malice have persuaded you some of them having first convinced
475	themselves all this class of men are most difficult to deal with for I
476	cannot have them up here and cross examine them and therefore I must
477	simply fight with shadows in my own defence and argue when there is no one
478	who answers I will ask you then to assume with me as I was saying that
479	my opponents are of two kinds one recent the other ancient and I hope
480	that you will see the propriety of my answering the latter first for these
481	accusations you heard long before the others and much oftener 
483	Well then I must make my defence and endeavour to clear away in a short
484	time a slander which has lasted a long time May I succeed if to succeed
485	be for my good and yours or likely to avail me in my cause The task is
486	not an easy one I quite understand the nature of it And so leaving the
487	event with God in obedience to the law I will now make my defence 
489	I will begin at the beginning and ask what is the accusation which has
490	given rise to the slander of me and in fact has encouraged Meletus to
491	proof this charge against me Well what do the slanderers say They
492	shall be my prosecutors and I will sum up their words in an affidavit 
493	 Socrates is an evil doer and a curious person who searches into things
494	under the earth and in heaven and he makes the worse appear the better
495	cause and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others Such is the
496	nature of the accusation it is just what you have yourselves seen in the
497	comedy of Aristophanes Aristoph Clouds who has introduced a man whom
498	he calls Socrates going about and saying that he walks in air and talking
499	a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know
500	either much or little not that I mean to speak disparagingly of any one
501	who is a student of natural philosophy I should be very sorry if Meletus
502	could bring so grave a charge against me But the simple truth is O
503	Athenians that I have nothing to do with physical speculations Very many
504	of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this and to them I
505	appeal Speak then you who have heard me and tell your neighbours
506	whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many
507	upon such matters You hear their answer And from what they say of this
508	part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest 
510	As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher and take
511	money this accusation has no more truth in it than the other Although 
512	if a man were really able to instruct mankind to receive money for giving
513	instruction would in my opinion be an honour to him There is Gorgias of
514	Leontium and Prodicus of Ceos and Hippias of Elis who go the round of
515	the cities and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own
516	citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing and come to them whom
517	they not only pay but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them 
518	There is at this time a Parian philosopher residing in Athens of whom I
519	have heard and I came to hear of him in this way I came across a man who
520	has spent a world of money on the Sophists Callias the son of Hipponicus 
521	and knowing that he had sons I asked him Callias I said if your two
522	sons were foals or calves there would be no difficulty in finding some one
523	to put over them we should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably 
524	who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and
525	excellence but as they are human beings whom are you thinking of placing
526	over them Is there any one who understands human and political virtue 
527	You must have thought about the matter for you have sons is there any
528	one There is he said Who is he said I and of what country and
529	what does he charge Evenus the Parian he replied he is the man and
530	his charge is five minae Happy is Evenus I said to myself if he really
531	has this wisdom and teaches at such a moderate charge Had I the same I
532	should have been very proud and conceited but the truth is that I have no
533	knowledge of the kind 
535	I dare say Athenians that some one among you will reply Yes Socrates 
536	but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against you 
537	there must have been something strange which you have been doing All
538	these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had
539	been like other men tell us then what is the cause of them for we
540	should be sorry to judge hastily of you Now I regard this as a fair
541	challenge and I will endeavour to explain to you the reason why I am
542	called wise and have such an evil fame Please to attend then And
543	although some of you may think that I am joking I declare that I will tell
544	you the entire truth Men of Athens this reputation of mine has come of a
545	certain sort of wisdom which I possess If you ask me what kind of wisdom 
546	I reply wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man for to that extent
547	I am inclined to believe that I am wise whereas the persons of whom I was
548	speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may fail to describe because I
549	have it not myself and he who says that I have speaks falsely and is
550	taking away my character And here O men of Athens I must beg you not to
551	interrupt me even if I seem to say something extravagant For the word
552	which I will speak is not mine I will refer you to a witness who is
553	worthy of credit that witness shall be the God of Delphi he will tell you
554	about my wisdom if I have any and of what sort it is You must have
555	known Chaerephon he was early a friend of mine and also a friend of
556	yours for he shared in the recent exile of the people and returned with
557	you Well Chaerephon as you know was very impetuous in all his doings 
558	and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether as I
559	was saying I must beg you not to interrupt he asked the oracle to tell
560	him whether anyone was wiser than I was and the Pythian prophetess
561	answered that there was no man wiser Chaerephon is dead himself but his
562	brother who is in court will confirm the truth of what I am saying 
564	Why do I mention this Because I am going to explain to you why I have
565	such an evil name When I heard the answer I said to myself What can the
566	god mean and what is the interpretation of his riddle for I know that I
567	have no wisdom small or great What then can he mean when he says that I
568	am the wisest of men And yet he is a god and cannot lie that would be
569	against his nature After long consideration I thought of a method of
570	trying the question I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser
571	than myself then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand I
572	should say to him Here is a man who is wiser than I am but you said that
573	I was the wisest Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of
574	wisdom and observed him his name I need not mention he was a politician
575	whom I selected for examination and the result was as follows When I
576	began to talk with him I could not help thinking that he was not really
577	wise although he was thought wise by many and still wiser by himself and
578	thereupon I tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise but was
579	not really wise and the consequence was that he hated me and his enmity
580	was shared by several who were present and heard me So I left him saying
581	to myself as I went away Well although I do not suppose that either of
582	us knows anything really beautiful and good I am better off than he is 
583	for he knows nothing and thinks that he knows I neither know nor think
584	that I know In this latter particular then I seem to have slightly the
585	advantage of him Then I went to another who had still higher pretensions
586	to wisdom and my conclusion was exactly the same Whereupon I made
587	another enemy of him and of many others besides him 
589	Then I went to one man after another being not unconscious of the enmity
590	which I provoked and I lamented and feared this but necessity was laid
591	upon me the word of God I thought ought to be considered first And I
592	said to myself Go I must to all who appear to know and find out the
593	meaning of the oracle And I swear to you Athenians by the dog I swear 
594	 for I must tell you the truth the result of my mission was just this I
595	found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish and that
596	others less esteemed were really wiser and better I will tell you the
597	tale of my wanderings and of the Herculean labours as I may call them 
598	which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable After the
599	politicians I went to the poets tragic dithyrambic and all sorts And
600	there I said to myself you will be instantly detected now you will find
601	out that you are more ignorant than they are Accordingly I took them
602	some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings and asked what
603	was the meaning of them thinking that they would teach me something Will
604	you believe me I am almost ashamed to confess the truth but I must say
605	that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better
606	about their poetry than they did themselves Then I knew that not by
607	wisdom do poets write poetry but by a sort of genius and inspiration they
608	are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things but do not
609	understand the meaning of them The poets appeared to me to be much in the
610	same case and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry
611	they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which
612	they were not wise So I departed conceiving myself to be superior to
613	them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians 
615	At last I went to the artisans I was conscious that I knew nothing at
616	all as I may say and I was sure that they knew many fine things and here
617	I was not mistaken for they did know many things of which I was ignorant 
618	and in this they certainly were wiser than I was But I observed that even
619	the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets because they were
620	good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters 
621	and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom and therefore I asked
622	myself on behalf of the oracle whether I would like to be as I was 
623	neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance or like them in both 
624	and I made answer to myself and to the oracle that I was better off as I
625	was 
627	This inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most
628	dangerous kind and has given occasion also to many calumnies And I am
629	called wise for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom
630	which I find wanting in others but the truth is O men of Athens that
631	God only is wise and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of
632	men is worth little or nothing he is not speaking of Socrates he is only
633	using my name by way of illustration as if he said He O men is the
634	wisest who like Socrates knows that his wisdom is in truth worth
635	nothing And so I go about the world obedient to the god and search and
636	make enquiry into the wisdom of any one whether citizen or stranger who
637	appears to be wise and if he is not wise then in vindication of the
638	oracle I show him that he is not wise and my occupation quite absorbs me 
639	and I have no time to give either to any public matter of interest or to
640	any concern of my own but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion
641	to the god 
643	There is another thing young men of the richer classes who have not much
644	to do come about me of their own accord they like to hear the pretenders
645	examined and they often imitate me and proceed to examine others there
646	are plenty of persons as they quickly discover who think that they know
647	something but really know little or nothing and then those who are
648	examined by them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me 
649	This confounded Socrates they say this villainous misleader of youth 
650	and then if somebody asks them Why what evil does he practise or teach 
651	they do not know and cannot tell but in order that they may not appear to
652	be at a loss they repeat the ready made charges which are used against all
653	philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth 
654	and having no gods and making the worse appear the better cause for they
655	do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected 
656	which is the truth and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic 
657	and are drawn up in battle array and have persuasive tongues they have
658	filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies And this is the
659	reason why my three accusers Meletus and Anytus and Lycon have set upon
660	me Meletus who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets Anytus on
661	behalf of the craftsmen and politicians Lycon on behalf of the
662	rhetoricians and as I said at the beginning I cannot expect to get rid
663	of such a mass of calumny all in a moment And this O men of Athens is
664	the truth and the whole truth I have concealed nothing I have dissembled
665	nothing And yet I know that my plainness of speech makes them hate me 
666	and what is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth Hence
667	has arisen the prejudice against me and this is the reason of it as you
668	will find out either in this or in any future enquiry 
670	I have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers I
671	turn to the second class They are headed by Meletus that good man and
672	true lover of his country as he calls himself Against these too I must
673	try to make a defence Let their affidavit be read it contains something
674	of this kind It says that Socrates is a doer of evil who corrupts the
675	youth and who does not believe in the gods of the state but has other new
676	divinities of his own Such is the charge and now let us examine the
677	particular counts He says that I am a doer of evil and corrupt the
678	youth but I say O men of Athens that Meletus is a doer of evil in that
679	he pretends to be in earnest when he is only in jest and is so eager to
680	bring men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest about matters in
681	which he really never had the smallest interest And the truth of this I
682	will endeavour to prove to you 
684	Come hither Meletus and let me ask a question of you You think a great
685	deal about the improvement of youth 
687	Yes I do 
689	Tell the judges then who is their improver for you must know as you
690	have taken the pains to discover their corrupter and are citing and
691	accusing me before them Speak then and tell the judges who their
692	improver is Observe Meletus that you are silent and have nothing to
693	say But is not this rather disgraceful and a very considerable proof of
694	what I was saying that you have no interest in the matter Speak up 
695	friend and tell us who their improver is 
697	The laws 
699	But that my good sir is not my meaning I want to know who the person
700	is who in the first place knows the laws 
702	The judges Socrates who are present in court 
704	What do you mean to say Meletus that they are able to instruct and
705	improve youth 
707	Certainly they are 
709	What all of them or some only and not others 
711	All of them 
713	By the goddess Here that is good news There are plenty of improvers 
714	then And what do you say of the audience do they improve them 
716	Yes they do 
718	And the senators 
720	Yes the senators improve them 
722	But perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt them or do they too
723	improve them 
725	They improve them 
727	Then every Athenian improves and elevates them all with the exception of
728	myself and I alone am their corrupter Is that what you affirm 
730	That is what I stoutly affirm 
732	I am very unfortunate if you are right But suppose I ask you a question 
733	How about horses Does one man do them harm and all the world good Is
734	not the exact opposite the truth One man is able to do them good or at
735	least not many the trainer of horses that is to say does them good and
736	others who have to do with them rather injure them Is not that true 
737	Meletus of horses or of any other animals Most assuredly it is whether
738	you and Anytus say yes or no Happy indeed would be the condition of youth
739	if they had one corrupter only and all the rest of the world were their
740	improvers But you Meletus have sufficiently shown that you never had a
741	thought about the young your carelessness is seen in your not caring
742	about the very things which you bring against me 
744	And now Meletus I will ask you another question by Zeus I will Which
745	is better to live among bad citizens or among good ones Answer friend 
746	I say the question is one which may be easily answered Do not the good
747	do their neighbours good and the bad do them evil 
749	Certainly 
751	And is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who
752	live with him Answer my good friend the law requires you to answer 
753	does any one like to be injured 
755	Certainly not 
757	And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth do you
758	allege that I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally 
760	Intentionally I say 
762	But you have just admitted that the good do their neighbours good and the
763	evil do them evil Now is that a truth which your superior wisdom has
764	recognized thus early in life and am I at my age in such darkness and
765	ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is
766	corrupted by me I am very likely to be harmed by him and yet I corrupt
767	him and intentionally too so you say although neither I nor any other
768	human being is ever likely to be convinced by you But either I do not
769	corrupt them or I corrupt them unintentionally and on either view of the
770	case you lie If my offence is unintentional the law has no cognizance of
771	unintentional offences you ought to have taken me privately and warned
772	and admonished me for if I had been better advised I should have left off
773	doing what I only did unintentionally no doubt I should but you would
774	have nothing to say to me and refused to teach me And now you bring me up
775	in this court which is a place not of instruction but of punishment 
777	It will be very clear to you Athenians as I was saying that Meletus has
778	no care at all great or small about the matter But still I should like
779	to know Meletus in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young I suppose
780	you mean as I infer from your indictment that I teach them not to
781	acknowledge the gods which the state acknowledges but some other new
782	divinities or spiritual agencies in their stead These are the lessons by
783	which I corrupt the youth as you say 
785	Yes that I say emphatically 
787	Then by the gods Meletus of whom we are speaking tell me and the court 
788	in somewhat plainer terms what you mean for I do not as yet understand
789	whether you affirm that I teach other men to acknowledge some gods and
790	therefore that I do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist this you
791	do not lay to my charge but only you say that they are not the same gods
792	which the city recognizes the charge is that they are different gods Or 
793	do you mean that I am an atheist simply and a teacher of atheism 
795	I mean the latter that you are a complete atheist 
797	What an extraordinary statement Why do you think so Meletus Do you
798	mean that I do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon like other
799	men 
801	I assure you judges that he does not for he says that the sun is stone 
802	and the moon earth 
804	Friend Meletus you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras and you have
805	but a bad opinion of the judges if you fancy them illiterate to such a
806	degree as not to know that these doctrines are found in the books of
807	Anaxagoras the Clazomenian which are full of them And so forsooth the
808	youth are said to be taught them by Socrates when there are not
809	unfrequently exhibitions of them at the theatre Probably in allusion to
810	Aristophanes who caricatured and to Euripides who borrowed the notions of
811	Anaxagoras as well as to other dramatic poets price of admission one
812	drachma at the most and they might pay their money and laugh at Socrates
813	if he pretends to father these extraordinary views And so Meletus you
814	really think that I do not believe in any god 
816	I swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all 
818	Nobody will believe you Meletus and I am pretty sure that you do not
819	believe yourself I cannot help thinking men of Athens that Meletus is
820	reckless and impudent and that he has written this indictment in a spirit
821	of mere wantonness and youthful bravado Has he not compounded a riddle 
822	thinking to try me He said to himself I shall see whether the wise
823	Socrates will discover my facetious contradiction or whether I shall be
824	able to deceive him and the rest of them For he certainly does appear to
825	me to contradict himself in the indictment as much as if he said that
826	Socrates is guilty of not believing in the gods and yet of believing in
827	them but this is not like a person who is in earnest 
829	I should like you O men of Athens to join me in examining what I conceive
830	to be his inconsistency and do you Meletus answer And I must remind
831	the audience of my request that they would not make a disturbance if I
832	speak in my accustomed manner 
834	Did ever man Meletus believe in the existence of human things and not of
835	human beings I wish men of Athens that he would answer and not be
836	always trying to get up an interruption Did ever any man believe in
837	horsemanship and not in horses or in flute playing and not in flute 
838	players No my friend I will answer to you and to the court as you
839	refuse to answer for yourself There is no man who ever did But now
840	please to answer the next question Can a man believe in spiritual and
841	divine agencies and not in spirits or demigods 
843	He cannot 
845	How lucky I am to have extracted that answer by the assistance of the
846	court But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in
847	divine or spiritual agencies new or old no matter for that at any rate 
848	I believe in spiritual agencies so you say and swear in the affidavit 
849	and yet if I believe in divine beings how can I help believing in spirits
850	or demigods must I not To be sure I must and therefore I may assume
851	that your silence gives consent Now what are spirits or demigods Are
852	they not either gods or the sons of gods 
854	Certainly they are 
856	But this is what I call the facetious riddle invented by you the demigods
857	or spirits are gods and you say first that I do not believe in gods and
858	then again that I do believe in gods that is if I believe in demigods 
859	For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods whether by the
860	nymphs or by any other mothers of whom they are said to be the sons what
861	human being will ever believe that there are no gods if they are the sons
862	of gods You might as well affirm the existence of mules and deny that of
863	horses and asses Such nonsense Meletus could only have been intended by
864	you to make trial of me You have put this into the indictment because you
865	had nothing real of which to accuse me But no one who has a particle of
866	understanding will ever be convinced by you that the same men can believe
867	in divine and superhuman things and yet not believe that there are gods
868	and demigods and heroes 
870	I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus any elaborate
871	defence is unnecessary but I know only too well how many are the enmities
872	which I have incurred and this is what will be my destruction if I am
873	destroyed not Meletus nor yet Anytus but the envy and detraction of the
874	world which has been the death of many good men and will probably be the
875	death of many more there is no danger of my being the last of them 
877	Some one will say And are you not ashamed Socrates of a course of life
878	which is likely to bring you to an untimely end To him I may fairly
879	answer There you are mistaken a man who is good for anything ought not
880	to calculate the chance of living or dying he ought only to consider
881	whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong acting the part of a
882	good man or of a bad Whereas upon your view the heroes who fell at Troy
883	were not good for much and the son of Thetis above all who altogether
884	despised danger in comparison with disgrace and when he was so eager to
885	slay Hector his goddess mother said to him that if he avenged his
886	companion Patroclus and slew Hector he would die himself Fate she
887	said in these or the like words waits for you next after Hector he 
888	receiving this warning utterly despised danger and death and instead of
889	fearing them feared rather to live in dishonour and not to avenge his
890	friend Let me die forthwith he replies and be avenged of my enemy 
891	rather than abide here by the beaked ships a laughing stock and a burden
892	of the earth Had Achilles any thought of death and danger For wherever
893	a man s place is whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he
894	has been placed by a commander there he ought to remain in the hour of
895	danger he should not think of death or of anything but of disgrace And
896	this O men of Athens is a true saying 
898	Strange indeed would be my conduct O men of Athens if I who when I was
899	ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and
900	Amphipolis and Delium remained where they placed me like any other man 
901	facing death if now when as I conceive and imagine God orders me to
902	fulfil the philosopher s mission of searching into myself and other men I
903	were to desert my post through fear of death or any other fear that would
904	indeed be strange and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the
905	existence of the gods if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of
906	death fancying that I was wise when I was not wise For the fear of death
907	is indeed the pretence of wisdom and not real wisdom being a pretence of
908	knowing the unknown and no one knows whether death which men in their
909	fear apprehend to be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good Is
910	not this ignorance of a disgraceful sort the ignorance which is the
911	conceit that a man knows what he does not know And in this respect only I
912	believe myself to differ from men in general and may perhaps claim to be
913	wiser than they are that whereas I know but little of the world below I
914	do not suppose that I know but I do know that injustice and disobedience
915	to a better whether God or man is evil and dishonourable and I will
916	never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil And
917	therefore if you let me go now and are not convinced by Anytus who said
918	that since I had been prosecuted I must be put to death or if not that I
919	ought never to have been prosecuted at all and that if I escape now your
920	sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words if you say to me 
921	Socrates this time we will not mind Anytus and you shall be let off but
922	upon one condition that you are not to enquire and speculate in this way
923	any more and that if you are caught doing so again you shall die if this
924	was the condition on which you let me go I should reply Men of Athens I
925	honour and love you but I shall obey God rather than you and while I have
926	life and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of
927	philosophy exhorting any one whom I meet and saying to him after my
928	manner You my friend a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city
929	of Athens are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money
930	and honour and reputation and caring so little about wisdom and truth and
931	the greatest improvement of the soul which you never regard or heed at
932	all And if the person with whom I am arguing says Yes but I do care 
933	then I do not leave him or let him go at once but I proceed to interrogate
934	and examine and cross examine him and if I think that he has no virtue in
935	him but only says that he has I reproach him with undervaluing the
936	greater and overvaluing the less And I shall repeat the same words to
937	every one whom I meet young and old citizen and alien but especially to
938	the citizens inasmuch as they are my brethren For know that this is the
939	command of God and I believe that no greater good has ever happened in the
940	state than my service to the God For I do nothing but go about persuading
941	you all old and young alike not to take thought for your persons or your
942	properties but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of
943	the soul I tell you that virtue is not given by money but that from
944	virtue comes money and every other good of man public as well as private 
945	This is my teaching and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth 
946	I am a mischievous person But if any one says that this is not my
947	teaching he is speaking an untruth Wherefore O men of Athens I say to
948	you do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids and either acquit me or not 
949	but whichever you do understand that I shall never alter my ways not even
950	if I have to die many times 
952	Men of Athens do not interrupt but hear me there was an understanding
953	between us that you should hear me to the end I have something more to
954	say at which you may be inclined to cry out but I believe that to hear me
955	will be good for you and therefore I beg that you will not cry out I
956	would have you know that if you kill such an one as I am you will injure
957	yourselves more than you will injure me Nothing will injure me not
958	Meletus nor yet Anytus they cannot for a bad man is not permitted to
959	injure a better than himself I do not deny that Anytus may perhaps kill
960	him or drive him into exile or deprive him of civil rights and he may
961	imagine and others may imagine that he is inflicting a great injury upon
962	him but there I do not agree For the evil of doing as he is doing the
963	evil of unjustly taking away the life of another is greater far 
965	And now Athenians I am not going to argue for my own sake as you may
966	think but for yours that you may not sin against the God by condemning
967	me who am his gift to you For if you kill me you will not easily find a
968	successor to me who if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech am a
969	sort of gadfly given to the state by God and the state is a great and
970	noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size and
971	requires to be stirred into life I am that gadfly which God has attached
972	to the state and all day long and in all places am always fastening upon
973	you arousing and persuading and reproaching you You will not easily find
974	another like me and therefore I would advise you to spare me I dare say
975	that you may feel out of temper like a person who is suddenly awakened
976	from sleep and you think that you might easily strike me dead as Anytus
977	advises and then you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives 
978	unless God in his care of you sent you another gadfly When I say that I
979	am given to you by God the proof of my mission is this if I had been
980	like other men I should not have neglected all my own concerns or
981	patiently seen the neglect of them during all these years and have been
982	doing yours coming to you individually like a father or elder brother 
983	exhorting you to regard virtue such conduct I say would be unlike human
984	nature If I had gained anything or if my exhortations had been paid 
985	there would have been some sense in my doing so but now as you will
986	perceive not even the impudence of my accusers dares to say that I have
987	ever exacted or sought pay of any one of that they have no witness And I
988	have a sufficient witness to the truth of what I say my poverty 
990	Some one may wonder why I go about in private giving advice and busying
991	myself with the concerns of others but do not venture to come forward in
992	public and advise the state I will tell you why You have heard me speak
993	at sundry times and in divers places of an oracle or sign which comes to
994	me and is the divinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment This
995	sign which is a kind of voice first began to come to me when I was a
996	child it always forbids but never commands me to do anything which I am
997	going to do This is what deters me from being a politician And rightly 
998	as I think For I am certain O men of Athens that if I had engaged in
999	politics I should have perished long ago and done no good either to you
1000	or to myself And do not be offended at my telling you the truth for the
1001	truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any other multitude 
1002	honestly striving against the many lawless and unrighteous deeds which are
1003	done in a state will save his life he who will fight for the right if he
1004	would live even for a brief space must have a private station and not a
1005	public one 
1007	I can give you convincing evidence of what I say not words only but what
1008	you value far more actions Let me relate to you a passage of my own life
1009	which will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from
1010	any fear of death and that as I should have refused to yield I must have
1011	died at once I will tell you a tale of the courts not very interesting
1012	perhaps but nevertheless true The only office of state which I ever
1013	held O men of Athens was that of senator the tribe Antiochis which is
1014	my tribe had the presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken
1015	up the bodies of the slain after the battle of Arginusae and you proposed
1016	to try them in a body contrary to law as you all thought afterwards but
1017	at the time I was the only one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the
1018	illegality and I gave my vote against you and when the orators threatened
1019	to impeach and arrest me and you called and shouted I made up my mind
1020	that I would run the risk having law and justice with me rather than take
1021	part in your injustice because I feared imprisonment and death This
1022	happened in the days of the democracy But when the oligarchy of the
1023	Thirty was in power they sent for me and four others into the rotunda and
1024	bade us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis as they wanted to put him
1025	to death This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they were
1026	always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their
1027	crimes and then I showed not in word only but in deed that if I may be
1028	allowed to use such an expression I cared not a straw for death and that
1029	my great and only care was lest I should do an unrighteous or unholy thing 
1030	For the strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing
1031	wrong and when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis
1032	and fetched Leon but I went quietly home For which I might have lost my
1033	life had not the power of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end 
1034	And many will witness to my words 
1036	Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years if I
1037	had led a public life supposing that like a good man I had always
1038	maintained the right and had made justice as I ought the first thing No
1039	indeed men of Athens neither I nor any other man But I have been always
1040	the same in all my actions public as well as private and never have I
1041	yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed my
1042	disciples or to any other Not that I have any regular disciples But if
1043	any one likes to come and hear me while I am pursuing my mission whether
1044	he be young or old he is not excluded Nor do I converse only with those
1045	who pay but any one whether he be rich or poor may ask and answer me and
1046	listen to my words and whether he turns out to be a bad man or a good one 
1047	neither result can be justly imputed to me for I never taught or professed
1048	to teach him anything And if any one says that he has ever learned or
1049	heard anything from me in private which all the world has not heard let me
1050	tell you that he is lying 
1052	But I shall be asked Why do people delight in continually conversing with
1053	you I have told you already Athenians the whole truth about this
1054	matter they like to hear the cross examination of the pretenders to
1055	wisdom there is amusement in it Now this duty of cross examining other
1056	men has been imposed upon me by God and has been signified to me by
1057	oracles visions and in every way in which the will of divine power was
1058	ever intimated to any one This is true O Athenians or if not true 
1059	would be soon refuted If I am or have been corrupting the youth those of
1060	them who are now grown up and have become sensible that I gave them bad
1061	advice in the days of their youth should come forward as accusers and take
1062	their revenge or if they do not like to come themselves some of their
1063	relatives fathers brothers or other kinsmen should say what evil their
1064	families have suffered at my hands Now is their time Many of them I see
1065	in the court There is Crito who is of the same age and of the same deme
1066	with myself and there is Critobulus his son whom I also see Then again
1067	there is Lysanias of Sphettus who is the father of Aeschines he is
1068	present and also there is Antiphon of Cephisus who is the father of
1069	Epigenes and there are the brothers of several who have associated with
1070	me There is Nicostratus the son of Theosdotides and the brother of
1071	Theodotus now Theodotus himself is dead and therefore he at any rate 
1072	will not seek to stop him and there is Paralus the son of Demodocus who
1073	had a brother Theages and Adeimantus the son of Ariston whose brother
1074	Plato is present and Aeantodorus who is the brother of Apollodorus whom
1075	I also see I might mention a great many others some of whom Meletus
1076	should have produced as witnesses in the course of his speech and let him
1077	still produce them if he has forgotten I will make way for him And let
1078	him say if he has any testimony of the sort which he can produce Nay 
1079	Athenians the very opposite is the truth For all these are ready to
1080	witness on behalf of the corrupter of the injurer of their kindred as
1081	Meletus and Anytus call me not the corrupted youth only there might have
1082	been a motive for that but their uncorrupted elder relatives Why should
1083	they too support me with their testimony Why indeed except for the sake
1084	of truth and justice and because they know that I am speaking the truth 
1085	and that Meletus is a liar 
1087	Well Athenians this and the like of this is all the defence which I have
1088	to offer Yet a word more Perhaps there may be some one who is offended
1089	at me when he calls to mind how he himself on a similar or even a less
1090	serious occasion prayed and entreated the judges with many tears and how
1091	he produced his children in court which was a moving spectacle together
1092	with a host of relations and friends whereas I who am probably in danger
1093	of my life will do none of these things The contrast may occur to his
1094	mind and he may be set against me and vote in anger because he is
1095	displeased at me on this account Now if there be such a person among
1096	you mind I do not say that there is to him I may fairly reply My
1097	friend I am a man and like other men a creature of flesh and blood and
1098	not of wood or stone as Homer says and I have a family yes and sons 
1099	O Athenians three in number one almost a man and two others who are
1100	still young and yet I will not bring any of them hither in order to
1101	petition you for an acquittal And why not Not from any self assertion
1102	or want of respect for you Whether I am or am not afraid of death is
1103	another question of which I will not now speak But having regard to
1104	public opinion I feel that such conduct would be discreditable to myself 
1105	and to you and to the whole state One who has reached my years and who
1106	has a name for wisdom ought not to demean himself Whether this opinion
1107	of me be deserved or not at any rate the world has decided that Socrates
1108	is in some way superior to other men And if those among you who are said
1109	to be superior in wisdom and courage and any other virtue demean
1110	themselves in this way how shameful is their conduct I have seen men of
1111	reputation when they have been condemned behaving in the strangest
1112	manner they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something
1113	dreadful if they died and that they could be immortal if you only allowed
1114	them to live and I think that such are a dishonour to the state and that
1115	any stranger coming in would have said of them that the most eminent men of
1116	Athens to whom the Athenians themselves give honour and command are no
1117	better than women And I say that these things ought not to be done by
1118	those of us who have a reputation and if they are done you ought not to
1119	permit them you ought rather to show that you are far more disposed to
1120	condemn the man who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city ridiculous 
1121	than him who holds his peace 
1123	But setting aside the question of public opinion there seems to be
1124	something wrong in asking a favour of a judge and thus procuring an
1125	acquittal instead of informing and convincing him For his duty is not
1126	to make a present of justice but to give judgment and he has sworn that
1127	he will judge according to the laws and not according to his own good
1128	pleasure and we ought not to encourage you nor should you allow
1129	yourselves to be encouraged in this habit of perjury there can be no
1130	piety in that Do not then require me to do what I consider dishonourable
1131	and impious and wrong especially now when I am being tried for impiety on
1132	the indictment of Meletus For if O men of Athens by force of persuasion
1133	and entreaty I could overpower your oaths then I should be teaching you to
1134	believe that there are no gods and in defending should simply convict
1135	myself of the charge of not believing in them But that is not so far
1136	otherwise For I do believe that there are gods and in a sense higher
1137	than that in which any of my accusers believe in them And to you and to
1138	God I commit my cause to be determined by you as is best for you and me 
1140	 
1142	There are many reasons why I am not grieved O men of Athens at the vote
1143	of condemnation I expected it and am only surprised that the votes are
1144	so nearly equal for I had thought that the majority against me would have
1145	been far larger but now had thirty votes gone over to the other side I
1146	should have been acquitted And I may say I think that I have escaped
1147	Meletus I may say more for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon 
1148	any one may see that he would not have had a fifth part of the votes as
1149	the law requires in which case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand
1150	drachmae 
1152	And so he proposes death as the penalty And what shall I propose on my
1153	part O men of Athens Clearly that which is my due And what is my due 
1154	What return shall be made to the man who has never had the wit to be idle
1155	during his whole life but has been careless of what the many care for 
1156	wealth and family interests and military offices and speaking in the
1157	assembly and magistracies and plots and parties Reflecting that I was
1158	really too honest a man to be a politician and live I did not go where I
1159	could do no good to you or to myself but where I could do the greatest
1160	good privately to every one of you thither I went and sought to persuade
1161	every man among you that he must look to himself and seek virtue and
1162	wisdom before he looks to his private interests and look to the state
1163	before he looks to the interests of the state and that this should be the
1164	order which he observes in all his actions What shall be done to such an
1165	one Doubtless some good thing O men of Athens if he has his reward and
1166	the good should be of a kind suitable to him What would be a reward
1167	suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor and who desires leisure that
1168	he may instruct you There can be no reward so fitting as maintenance in
1169	the Prytaneum O men of Athens a reward which he deserves far more than
1170	the citizen who has won the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race 
1171	whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many For I am in
1172	want and he has enough and he only gives you the appearance of happiness 
1173	and I give you the reality And if I am to estimate the penalty fairly I
1174	should say that maintenance in the Prytaneum is the just return 
1176	Perhaps you think that I am braving you in what I am saying now as in what
1177	I said before about the tears and prayers But this is not so I speak
1178	rather because I am convinced that I never intentionally wronged any one 
1179	although I cannot convince you the time has been too short if there were
1180	a law at Athens as there is in other cities that a capital cause should
1181	not be decided in one day then I believe that I should have convinced you 
1182	But I cannot in a moment refute great slanders and as I am convinced that
1183	I never wronged another I will assuredly not wrong myself I will not say
1184	of myself that I deserve any evil or propose any penalty Why should I 
1185	because I am afraid of the penalty of death which Meletus proposes When I
1186	do not know whether death is a good or an evil why should I propose a
1187	penalty which would certainly be an evil Shall I say imprisonment And
1188	why should I live in prison and be the slave of the magistrates of the
1189	year of the Eleven Or shall the penalty be a fine and imprisonment
1190	until the fine is paid There is the same objection I should have to lie
1191	in prison for money I have none and cannot pay And if I say exile and
1192	this may possibly be the penalty which you will affix I must indeed be
1193	blinded by the love of life if I am so irrational as to expect that when
1194	you who are my own citizens cannot endure my discourses and words and
1195	have found them so grievous and odious that you will have no more of them 
1196	others are likely to endure me No indeed men of Athens that is not very
1197	likely And what a life should I lead at my age wandering from city to
1198	city ever changing my place of exile and always being driven out For I
1199	am quite sure that wherever I go there as here the young men will flock
1200	to me and if I drive them away their elders will drive me out at their
1201	request and if I let them come their fathers and friends will drive me
1202	out for their sakes 
1204	Some one will say Yes Socrates but cannot you hold your tongue and
1205	then you may go into a foreign city and no one will interfere with you 
1206	Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this 
1207	For if I tell you that to do as you say would be a disobedience to the God 
1208	and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue you will not believe that I am
1209	serious and if I say again that daily to discourse about virtue and of
1210	those other things about which you hear me examining myself and others is
1211	the greatest good of man and that the unexamined life is not worth living 
1212	you are still less likely to believe me Yet I say what is true although
1213	a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you Also I have never
1214	been accustomed to think that I deserve to suffer any harm Had I money I
1215	might have estimated the offence at what I was able to pay and not have
1216	been much the worse But I have none and therefore I must ask you to
1217	proportion the fine to my means Well perhaps I could afford a mina and
1218	therefore I propose that penalty Plato Crito Critobulus and
1219	Apollodorus my friends here bid me say thirty minae and they will be the
1220	sureties Let thirty minae be the penalty for which sum they will be
1221	ample security to you 
1223	 
1225	Not much time will be gained O Athenians in return for the evil name
1226	which you will get from the detractors of the city who will say that you
1227	killed Socrates a wise man for they will call me wise even although I am
1228	not wise when they want to reproach you If you had waited a little
1229	while your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature For
1230	I am far advanced in years as you may perceive and not far from death I
1231	am speaking now not to all of you but only to those who have condemned me
1232	to death And I have another thing to say to them you think that I was
1233	convicted because I had no words of the sort which would have procured my
1234	acquittal I mean if I had thought fit to leave nothing undone or unsaid 
1235	Not so the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words 
1236	certainly not But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to
1237	address you as you would have liked me to do weeping and wailing and
1238	lamenting and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed
1239	to hear from others and which as I maintain are unworthy of me I
1240	thought at the time that I ought not to do anything common or mean when in
1241	danger nor do I now repent of the style of my defence I would rather die
1242	having spoken after my manner than speak in your manner and live For
1243	neither in war nor yet at law ought I or any man to use every way of
1244	escaping death Often in battle there can be no doubt that if a man will
1245	throw away his arms and fall on his knees before his pursuers he may
1246	escape death and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death 
1247	if a man is willing to say and do anything The difficulty my friends is
1248	not to avoid death but to avoid unrighteousness for that runs faster than
1249	death I am old and move slowly and the slower runner has overtaken me 
1250	and my accusers are keen and quick and the faster runner who is
1251	unrighteousness has overtaken them And now I depart hence condemned by
1252	you to suffer the penalty of death they too go their ways condemned by
1253	the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong and I must abide by
1254	my award let them abide by theirs I suppose that these things may be
1255	regarded as fated and I think that they are well 
1257	And now O men who have condemned me I would fain prophesy to you for I
1258	am about to die and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic
1259	power And I prophesy to you who are my murderers that immediately after
1260	my departure punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will
1261	surely await you Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the
1262	accuser and not to give an account of your lives But that will not be as
1263	you suppose far otherwise For I say that there will be more accusers of
1264	you than there are now accusers whom hitherto I have restrained and as
1265	they are younger they will be more inconsiderate with you and you will be
1266	more offended at them If you think that by killing men you can prevent
1267	some one from censuring your evil lives you are mistaken that is not a
1268	way of escape which is either possible or honourable the easiest and the
1269	noblest way is not to be disabling others but to be improving yourselves 
1270	This is the prophecy which I utter before my departure to the judges who
1271	have condemned me 
1273	Friends who would have acquitted me I would like also to talk with you
1274	about the thing which has come to pass while the magistrates are busy and
1275	before I go to the place at which I must die Stay then a little for we
1276	may as well talk with one another while there is time You are my friends 
1277	and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened
1278	to me O my judges for you I may truly call judges I should like to tell
1279	you of a wonderful circumstance Hitherto the divine faculty of which the
1280	internal oracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing
1281	me even about trifles if I was going to make a slip or error in any
1282	matter and now as you see there has come upon me that which may be
1283	thought and is generally believed to be the last and worst evil But the
1284	oracle made no sign of opposition either when I was leaving my house in
1285	the morning or when I was on my way to the court or while I was speaking 
1286	at anything which I was going to say and yet I have often been stopped in
1287	the middle of a speech but now in nothing I either said or did touching
1288	the matter in hand has the oracle opposed me What do I take to be the
1289	explanation of this silence I will tell you It is an intimation that
1290	what has happened to me is a good and that those of us who think that
1291	death is an evil are in error For the customary sign would surely have
1292	opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good 
1294	Let us reflect in another way and we shall see that there is great reason
1295	to hope that death is a good for one of two things either death is a
1296	state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness or as men say there is a
1297	change and migration of the soul from this world to another Now if you
1298	suppose that there is no consciousness but a sleep like the sleep of him
1299	who is undisturbed even by dreams death will be an unspeakable gain For
1300	if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed
1301	even by dreams and were to compare with this the other days and nights of
1302	his life and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed
1303	in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one I think
1304	that any man I will not say a private man but even the great king will
1305	not find many such days or nights when compared with the others Now if
1306	death be of such a nature I say that to die is gain for eternity is then
1307	only a single night But if death is the journey to another place and
1308	there as men say all the dead abide what good O my friends and judges 
1309	can be greater than this If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world
1310	below he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world and
1311	finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there Minos and
1312	Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus and other sons of God who were
1313	righteous in their own life that pilgrimage will be worth making What
1314	would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and
1315	Hesiod and Homer Nay if this be true let me die again and again I
1316	myself too shall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and
1317	conversing with Palamedes and Ajax the son of Telamon and any other
1318	ancient hero who has suffered death through an unjust judgment and there
1319	will be no small pleasure as I think in comparing my own sufferings with
1320	theirs Above all I shall then be able to continue my search into true
1321	and false knowledge as in this world so also in the next and I shall
1322	find out who is wise and who pretends to be wise and is not What would
1323	not a man give O judges to be able to examine the leader of the great
1324	Trojan expedition or Odysseus or Sisyphus or numberless others men and
1325	women too What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them
1326	and asking them questions In another world they do not put a man to death
1327	for asking questions assuredly not For besides being happier than we
1328	are they will be immortal if what is said is true 
1330	Wherefore O judges be of good cheer about death and know of a certainty 
1331	that no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death He
1332	and his are not neglected by the gods nor has my own approaching end
1333	happened by mere chance But I see clearly that the time had arrived when
1334	it was better for me to die and be released from trouble wherefore the
1335	oracle gave no sign For which reason also I am not angry with my
1336	condemners or with my accusers they have done me no harm although they
1337	did not mean to do me any good and for this I may gently blame them 
1339	Still I have a favour to ask of them When my sons are grown up I would
1340	ask you O my friends to punish them and I would have you trouble them 
1341	as I have troubled you if they seem to care about riches or anything 
1342	more than about virtue or if they pretend to be something when they are
1343	really nothing then reprove them as I have reproved you for not caring
1344	about that for which they ought to care and thinking that they are
1345	something when they are really nothing And if you do this both I and my
1346	sons will have received justice at your hands 
1348	The hour of departure has arrived and we go our ways I to die and you to
1349	live Which is better God only knows
