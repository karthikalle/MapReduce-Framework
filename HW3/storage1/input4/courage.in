11	 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE LYSIMACHUS son of Aristides MELESIAS son
12	of Thucydides THEIR SONS NICIAS LACHES SOCRATES 
14	 Lys You have seen the exhibition of the man fighting in armour 
15	Nicias and Laches but we did not tell you at the time the reason
16	why my friend Melesias and I asked you to go with us and see him I
17	think that we may as well confess what this was for we certainly
18	ought not to have any reserve with you The reason was that we were
19	intending to ask your advice Some laugh at the very notion of
20	advising others and when they are asked will not say what they think 
21	They guess at the wishes of the person who asks them and answer
22	according to his and not according to their own opinion But as we
23	know that you are good judges and will say exactly what you think we
24	have taken you into our counsels The matter about which I am making
25	all this preface is as follows Melesias and I have two sons that
26	is his son and he is named Thucydides after his grandfather and
27	this is mine who is also called after his grandfather Aristides 
28	Now we are resolved to take the greatest care of the youths and
29	not to let them run about as they like which is too often the way
30	with the young when they are no longer children but to begin at once
31	and do the utmost that we can for them And knowing you to have sons
32	of your own we thought that you were most likely to have attended
33	to their training and improvement and if perchance you have not
34	attended to them we may remind you that you ought to have done so 
35	and would invite you to assist us in the fulfillment of a common duty 
36	I will tell you Nicias and Laches even at the risk of being tedious 
37	how we came to think of this Melesias and I live together and our
38	sons live with us and now as I was saying at first we are going
39	to confess to you Both of us often talk to the lads about the many
40	noble deeds which our own fathers did in war and peace in the
41	management of the allies and in the administration of the city but
42	neither of us has any deeds of his own which he can show The truth is
43	that we are ashamed of this contrast being seen by them and we
44	blame our fathers for letting us be spoiled in the days of our
45	youth while they were occupied with the concerns of others and we
46	urge all this upon the lads pointing out to them that they will not
47	grow up to honour if they are rebellious and take no pains about
48	themselves but that if they take pains they may perhaps become
49	worthy of the names which they bear They on their part promise to
50	comply with our wishes and our care is to discover what studies or
51	pursuits are likely to be most improving to them Some one commended
52	to us the art of fighting in armour which he thought an excellent
53	accomplishment for a young man to learn and he praised the man
54	whose exhibition you have seen and told us to go and see him And
55	we determined that we would go and get you to accompany us and we
56	were intending at the same time if you did not object to take
57	counsel with you about the education of our sons That is the matter
58	which we wanted to talk over with you and we hope that you will
59	give us your opinion about this art of fighting in armour and about
60	any other studies or pursuits which may or may not be desirable for
61	a young man to learn Please to say whether you agree to our proposal 
63	 Nic As far as I am concerned Lysimachus and Melesias I applaud
64	your purpose and will gladly assist you and I believe that you 
65	Laches will be equally glad 
67	 La Certainly Nicias and I quite approve of the remark which
68	Lysimachus made about his own father and the father of Melesias and
69	which is applicable not only to them but to us and to every one who
70	is occupied with public affairs As he says such persons are too
71	apt to be negligent and careless of their own children and their
72	private concerns There is much truth in that remark of yours 
73	Lysimachus But why instead of consulting us do you not consult
74	our friend Socrates about the education of the youths He is of the
75	same deme with you and is always passing his time in places where the
76	youth have any noble study or pursuit such as you are enquiring
77	after 
79	 Lys Why Laches has Socrates ever attended to matters of this
80	sort 
82	 La Certainly Lysimachus 
84	 Nic That I have the means of knowing as well as Laches for quite
85	lately he supplied me with a teacher of music for my sons Damon 
86	the disciple of Agathocles who is a most accomplished man in every
87	way as well as a musician and a companion of inestimable value for
88	young men at their age 
90	 Lys Those who have reached my time of life Socrates and Nicias and
91	Laches fall out of acquaintance with the young because they are
92	generally detained at home by old age but you O son of Sophroniscus 
93	should let your fellow demesman have the benefits of any advice
94	which you are able to give Moreover I have a claim upon you as an old
95	friend of your father for I and he were always companions and
96	friends and to the hour of his death there never was a difference
97	between us and now it comes back to me at the mention of your
98	name that I have heard these lads talking to one another at home and
99	often speaking of Socrates in terms of the highest praise but I
100	have never thought to ask them whether the son of Sophroniscus was the
101	person whom they meant Tell me my boys whether this is the Socrates
102	of whom you have often spoken 
104	 Son Certainly father this is he 
106	 Lys I am delighted to hear Socrates that you maintain the name of
107	your father who was a most excellent man and I further rejoice at
108	the prospect of our family ties being renewed 
110	 La Indeed Lysimachus you ought not to give him up for I can
111	assure you that I have seen him maintaining not only his father s 
112	but also his country s name He was my companion in the retreat from
113	Delium and I can tell you that if others had only been like him 
114	the honour of our country would have been upheld and the great defeat
115	would never have occurred 
117	 Lys That is very high praise which is accorded to you Socrates by
118	faithful witnesses and for actions like those which they praise Let
119	me tell you the pleasure which I feel in hearing of your fame and I
120	hope that you will regard me as one of your warmest friends You ought
121	to have visited us long ago and made yourself at home with us but
122	now from this day forward as we have at last found one another
123	out do as I say come and make acquaintance with me and with these
124	young men that I may continue your friend as I was your father s 
125	I shall expect you to do so and shall venture at some future time
126	to remind you of your duty But what say you of the matter of which we
127	were beginning to speak the art of fighting in armour Is that a
128	practice in which the lads may be advantageously instructed 
130	 Soc I will endeavour to advise you Lysimachus as far as I can
131	in this matter and also in every way will comply with your wishes 
132	but as I am younger and not so experienced I think that I ought
133	certainly to hear first what my elders have to say and to learn of
134	them and if I have anything to add then I may venture to give my
135	opinion to them as well as to you Suppose Nicias that one or
136	other of you begin 
138	 Nic I have no objection Socrates and my opinion is that the
139	acquirement of this art is in many ways useful to young men It is
140	an advantage to them that among the favourite amusements of their
141	leisure hours they should have one which tends to improve and not to
142	injure their bodily health No gymnastics could be better or harder
143	exercise and this and the art of riding are of all arts most
144	befitting to a freeman for they only who are thus trained in the
145	use of arms are the athletes of our military profession trained in
146	that on which the conflict turns Moreover in actual battle when
147	you have to fight in a line with a number of others such an
148	acquirement will be of some use and will be of the greatest
149	whenever the ranks are broken and you have to fight singly either
150	in pursuit when you are attacking some one who is defending
151	himself or in flight when you have to defend yourself against an
152	assailant Certainly he who possessed the art could not meet with
153	any harm at the hands of a single person or perhaps of several and
154	in any case he would have a great advantage Further this sort of
155	skill inclines a man to the love of other noble lessons for every man
156	who has learned how to fight in armour will desire to learn the proper
157	arrangement of an army which is the sequel of the lesson and when he
158	has learned this and his ambition is once fired he will go on to
159	learn the complete art of the general There is no difficulty in
160	seeing that the knowledge and practice of other military arts will
161	be honourable and valuable to a man and this lesson may be the
162	beginning of them Let me add a further advantage which is by no
163	means a slight one that this science will make any man a great deal
164	more valiant and self possessed in the field And I will not disdain
165	to mention what by some may he thought to be a small matter he
166	will make a better appearance at the right time that is to say at
167	the time when his appearance will strike terror into his enemies My
168	opinion then Lysimachus is as I say that the youths should be
169	instructed in this art and for the reasons which I have given But
170	Laches may take a different view and I shall be very glad to hear
171	what he has to say 
173	 La I should not like to maintain Nicias that any kind of
174	knowledge is not to be learned for all knowledge appears to be a
175	good and if as Nicias and as the teachers of the art affirm this
176	use of arms is really a species of knowledge then it ought to be
177	learned but if not and if those who profess to teach it are
178	deceivers only or if it be knowledge but not of a valuable sort 
179	then what is the use of learning it I say this because I think
180	that if it had been really valuable the Lacedaemonians whose whole
181	life is passed in finding out and practising the arts which give
182	them an advantage over other nations in war would have discovered
183	this one And even if they had not still these professors of the
184	art would certainly not have failed to discover that of all the
185	Hellenes the Lacedaemonians have the greatest interest in such
186	matters and that a master of the art who was honoured among them
187	would be sure to make his fortune among other nations just as a
188	tragic poet would who is honoured among ourselves which is the reason
189	why he who fancies that he can write a tragedy does not go about
190	itinerating in the neighbouring states but rushes straight and
191	exhibits at Athens and this is natural Whereas I perceive that these
192	fighters in armour regard Lacedaemon as a sacred inviolable territory 
193	which they do not touch with the point of their foot but they make
194	a circuit of the neighbouring states and would rather exhibit to
195	any others than to the Spartans and particularly to those who would
196	themselves acknowledge that they are by no means first rate in the
197	arts of war Further Lysimachus I have encountered a good many of
198	these gentlemen in actual service and have taken their measure which
199	I can give you at once for none of these masters of fence have ever
200	been distinguished in war there has been a sort of fatality about
201	them while in all other arts the men of note have been always those
202	who have practised the art they appear to be a most unfortunate
203	exception For example this very Stesilaus whom you and I have
204	just witnessed exhibiting in all that crowd and making such great
205	professions of his powers I have seen at another time making in
206	sober truth an involuntary exhibition of himself which was a far
207	better spectacle He was a marine on board a ship which struck a
208	transport vessel and was armed with a weapon half spear half scythe 
209	the singularity of this weapon was worthy of the singularity of the
210	man To make a long story short I will only tell you what happened to
211	this notable invention of the scythe spear He was fighting and the
212	scythe was caught in the rigging of the other ship and stuck fast 
213	and he tugged but was unable to get his weapon free The two ships
214	were passing one another He first ran along his own ship holding on
215	to the spear but as the other ship passed by and drew him after as he
216	was holding on he let the spear slip through his hand until he
217	retained only the end of the handle The people in the transport
218	clapped their hands and laughed at his ridiculous figure and when
219	some one threw a stone which fell on the deck at his feet and he
220	quitted of the scythe spear the crew of his own trireme also burst
221	out laughing they could not refrain when they beheld the weapon
222	waving in the air suspended from the transport Now I do not deny
223	that there may be something in such an art as Nicias asserts but I
224	tell you my experience and as I said at first whether this be an
225	art of which the advantage is so slight or not an art at all but
226	only an imposition in either case such an acquirement is not worth
227	having For my opinion is that if the professor of this art be a
228	coward he will be likely to become rash and his character will be
229	only more notorious or if he be brave and fail ever so little other
230	men will be on the watch and he will be greatly traduced for there
231	is a jealousy of such pretenders and unless a man be preeminent in
232	valour he cannot help being ridiculous if he says that he has this
233	sort of skill Such is my judgment Lysimachus of the desirableness
234	of this art but as I said at first ask Socrates and do not let him
235	go until he has given you his opinion of the matter 
237	 Lys I am going to ask this favour of you Socrates as is the
238	more necessary because the two councillors disagree and some one is
239	in a manner still needed who will decide between them Had they
240	agreed no arbiter would have been required But as Laches has voted
241	one way and Nicias another I should like to hear with which of our
242	two friends you agree 
244	 Soc What Lysimachus are you going to accept the opinion of the
245	majority 
247	 Lys Why yes Socrates what else am I to do 
249	 Soc And would you do so too Melesias If you were deliberating
250	about the gymnastic training of your son would you follow the
251	advice of the majority of us or the opinion of the one who had been
252	trained and exercised under a skilful master 
254	 Mel The latter Socrates as would surely be reasonable 
256	 Soc His one vote would be worth more than the vote of all us four 
258	 Mel Certainly 
260	 Soc And for this reason as I imagine because a good decision is
261	based on knowledge and not on numbers 
263	 Mel To be sure 
265	 Soc Must we not then first of all ask whether there is any one
266	of us who has knowledge of that about which we are deliberating If
267	there is let us take his advice though he be one only and not
268	mind the rest if there is not let us seek further counsel Is this a
269	slight matter about which you and Lysimachus are deliberating Are you
270	not risking the greatest of your possessions For children are your
271	riches and upon their turning out well or ill depends the whole order
272	of their father s house 
274	 Mel That is true 
276	 Soc Great care then is required in this matter 
278	 Mel Certainly 
280	 Soc Suppose as I was just now saying that we were considering or
281	wanting to consider who was the best trainer Should we not select
282	him who knew and had practised the art and had the best teachers 
284	 Mel I think that we should 
286	 Soc But would there not arise a prior question about the nature
287	of the art of which we want to find the masters 
289	 Mel I do not understand 
291	 Soc Let me try to make my meaning plainer then I do not think that
292	we have as yet decided what that is about which we are consulting 
293	when we ask which of us is or is not skilled in the art and has or
294	has not had a teacher of the art 
296	 Nic Why Socrates is not the question whether young men ought or
297	ought not to learn the art of fighting in armour 
299	 Soc Yes Nicias but there is also a prior question which I may
300	illustrate in this way When a person considers about applying a
301	medicine to the eyes would you say that he is consulting about the
302	medicine or about the eyes 
304	 Nic About the eyes 
306	 Soc And when he considers whether he shall set a bridle on a
307	horse and at what time he is thinking of the horse and not of the
308	bridle 
310	 Nic True 
312	 Soc And in a word when he considers anything for the sake of
313	another thing he thinks of the end and not of the means 
315	 Nic Certainly 
317	 Soc And when you call in an adviser you should see whether he
318	too is skilful in the accomplishment of the end which you have in
319	view 
321	 Nic Most true 
323	 Soc And at present we have in view some knowledge of which the end
324	is the soul of youth 
326	 Nic Yes 
328	 Soc And we are enquiring Which of us is skilful or successful in
329	the treatment of the soul and which of us has had good teachers 
331	 La Well but Socrates did you never observe that some persons who
332	have had no teachers are more skilful than those who have in some
333	things 
335	 Soc Yes Laches I have observed that but you would not be very
336	willing to trust them if they only professed to be masters of their
337	art unless they could show some proof of their skill or excellence in
338	one or more works 
340	 La That is true 
342	 Soc And therefore Laches and Nicias as Lysimachus and Melesias 
343	in their anxiety to improve the minds of their sons have asked our
344	advice about them we too should tell them who our teachers were if
345	we say that we have had any and prove them to be in the first place
346	men of merit and experienced trainers of the minds of youth and also
347	to have been really our teachers Or if any of us says that he has
348	no teacher but that he has works of his own to show then he should
349	point out to them what Athenians or strangers bond or free he is
350	generally acknowledged to have improved But if he can show neither
351	teachers nor works then he should tell them to look out for others 
352	and not run the risk of spoiling the children of friends and
353	thereby incurring the most formidable accusation which can be
354	brought against any one by those nearest to him As for myself 
355	Lysimachus and Melesias I am the first to confess that I have never
356	had a teacher of the art of virtue although I have always from my
357	earliest youth desired to have one But I am too poor to give money to
358	the Sophists who are the only professors of moral improvement and to
359	this day I have never been able to discover the art myself though I
360	should not be surprised if Nicias or Laches may have discovered or
361	learned it for they are far wealthier than I am and may therefore
362	have learnt of others And they are older too so that they have had
363	more time to make the discovery And I really believe that they are
364	able to educate a man for unless they had been confident in their own
365	knowledge they would never have spoken thus decidedly of the pursuits
366	which are advantageous or hurtful to a young man I repose
367	confidence in both of them but I am surprised to find that they
368	differ from one another And therefore Lysimachus as Laches
369	suggested that you should detain me and not let me go until I
370	answered I in turn earnestly beseech and advise you to detain
371	Laches and Nicias and question them I would have you say to them 
372	Socrates avers that he has no knowledge of the matter he is unable
373	to decide which of you speaks truly neither discoverer nor student is
374	he of anything of the kind But you Laches and Nicias should each of
375	you tell us who is the most skilful educator whom you have ever known 
376	and whether you invented the art yourselves or learned of another 
377	and if you learned who were your respective teachers and who were
378	their brothers in the art and then if you are too much occupied in
379	politics to teach us yourselves let us go to them and present them
380	with gifts or make interest with them or both in the hope that they
381	may be induced to take charge of our children and of yours and then
382	they will not grow up inferior and disgrace their ancestors But if
383	you are yourselves original discoverers in that field give us some
384	proof of your skill Who are they who having been inferior persons 
385	have become under your care good and noble For if this is your
386	first attempt at education there is a danger that you may be trying
387	the experiment not on the vile corpus of a Carian slave but on
388	your own sons or the sons of your friend and as the proverb says 
389	 break the large vessel in learning to make pots Tell us then 
390	what qualities you claim or do not claim Make them tell you that 
391	Lysimachus and do not let them off 
393	 Lys I very much approve of the words of Socrates my friends but
394	you Nicias and Laches must determine whether you will be questioned 
395	and give an explanation about matters of this sort Assuredly I and
396	Melesias would be greatly pleased to hear you answer the questions
397	which Socrates asks if you will for I began by saying that we took
398	you into our counsels because we thought that you would have
399	attended to the subject especially as you have children who like our
400	own are nearly of an age to be educated Well then if you have no
401	objection suppose that you take Socrates into partnership and do you
402	and he ask and answer one another s questions for as he has well
403	said we are deliberating about the most important of our concerns 
404	I hope that you will see fit to comply with our request 
406	 Nic I see very clearly Lysimachus that you have only known
407	Socrates father and have no acquaintance with Socrates himself at
408	least you can only have known him when he was a child and may have
409	met him among his fellow wardsmen in company with his father at a
410	sacrifice or at some other gathering You clearly show that you
411	have never known him since he arrived at manhood 
413	 Lys Why do you say that Nicias 
415	 Nic Because you seem not to be aware that any one who has an
416	intellectual affinity to Socrates and enters into conversation with
417	him is liable to be drawn into an argument and whatever subject he
418	may start he will be continually carried round and round by him 
419	until at last he finds that he has to give an account both of his
420	present and past life and when he is once entangled Socrates will
421	not let him go until he has completely and thoroughly sifted him 
422	Now I am used to his ways and I know that he will certainly do as I
423	say and also that I myself shall be the sufferer for I am fond of
424	his conversation Lysimachus And I think that there is no harm in
425	being reminded of any wrong thing which we are or have been doing 
426	he who does not fly from reproof will be sure to take more heed of his
427	after life as Solon says he will wish and desire to be learning so
428	long as he lives and will not think that old age of itself brings
429	wisdom To me to be cross examined by Socrates is neither unusual nor
430	unpleasant indeed I knew all along that where Socrates was the
431	argument would soon pass from our sons to ourselves and therefore 
432	I say that for my part I am quite willing to discourse with
433	Socrates in his own manner but you had better ask our friend Laches
434	what his feeling may be 
436	 La I have but one feeling Nicias or shall I say two
437	feelings about discussions Some would think that I am a lover and
438	to others I may seem to be a hater of discourse for when I hear a man
439	discoursing of virtue or of any sort of wisdom who is a true man and
440	worthy of his theme I am delighted beyond measure and I compare
441	the man and his words and note the harmony and correspondence of
442	them And such an one I deem to be the true musician attuned to a
443	fairer harmony than that of the lyre or any pleasant instrument of
444	music for truly he has in his own life a harmony of words and deeds
445	arranged not in the Ionian or in the Phrygian mode nor yet in the
446	Lydian but in the true Hellenic mode which is the Dorian and no
447	other Such an one makes me merry with the sound of his voice and
448	when I hear him I am thought to be a lover of discourse so eager am I
449	in drinking in his words But a man whose actions do not agree with
450	his words is an annoyance to me and the better he speaks the more I
451	hate him and then I seem to be a hater of discourse As to
452	Socrates I have no knowledge of his words but of old as would seem 
453	I have had experience of his deeds and his deeds show that free and
454	noble sentiments are natural to him And if his words accord then I
455	am of one mind with him and shall be delighted to be interrogated
456	by a man such as he is and shall not be annoyed at having to learn of
457	him for I too agree with Solon that I would fain grow old learning
458	many things But I must be allowed to add of the good only 
459	Socrates must be willing to allow that he is a good teacher or I
460	shall be a dull and uncongenial pupil but that the teacher is
461	younger or not as yet in repute anything of that sort is of no
462	account with me And therefore Socrates I give you notice that you
463	may teach and confute me as much as ever you like and also learn of
464	me anything which I know So high is the opinion which I have
465	entertained of you ever since the day on which you were my companion
466	in danger and gave a proof of your valour such as only the man of
467	merit can give Therefore say whatever you like and do not mind
468	about the difference of our ages 
470	 Soc I cannot say that either of you show any reluctance to take
471	counsel and advise with me 
473	 Lys But this is our proper business and yours as well as ours for
474	I reckon you as one of us Please then to take my place and find
475	out from Nicias and Laches what we want to know for the sake of the
476	youths and talk and consult with them for I am old and my memory is
477	bad and I do not remember the questions which I am going to ask or
478	the answers to them and if there is any interruption I am quite lost 
479	I will therefore beg of you to carry on the proposed discussion by
480	yourselves and I will listen and Melesias and I will act upon your
481	conclusions 
483	 Soc Let us Nicias and Laches comply with the request of
484	Lysimachus and Melesias There will be no harm in asking ourselves the
485	question which was first proposed to us Who have been our own
486	instructors in this sort of training and whom have we made better 
487	But the other mode of carrying on the enquiry will bring us equally to
488	the same point and will be more like proceeding from first
489	principles For if we knew that the addition of something would
490	improve some other thing and were able to make the addition then 
491	clearly we must know how that about which we are advising may be best
492	and most easily attained Perhaps you do not understand what I mean 
493	Then let me make my meaning plainer in this way Suppose we knew
494	that the addition of sight makes better the eyes which possess this
495	gift and also were able to impart sight to the eyes then clearly 
496	we should know the nature of sight and should be able to advise how
497	this gift of sight may be best and most easily attained but if we
498	knew neither what sight is nor what hearing is we should not be very
499	good medical advisers about the eyes or the ears or about the best
500	mode of giving sight and hearing to them 
502	 La That is true Socrates 
504	 Soc And are not our two friends Laches at this very moment
505	inviting us to consider in what way the gift of virtue may be imparted
506	to their sons for the improvement of their minds 
508	 La Very true 
510	 Soc Then must we not first know the nature of virtue For how can
511	we advise any one about the best mode of attaining something of
512	which we are wholly ignorant 
514	 La I do not think that we can Socrates 
516	 Soc Then Laches we may presume that we know the nature of virtue 
518	 La Yes 
520	 Soc And that which we know we must surely be able to tell 
522	 La Certainly 
524	 Soc I would not have us begin my friend with enquiring about
525	the whole of virtue for that may be more than we can accomplish 
526	let us first consider whether we have a sufficient knowledge of a
527	part the enquiry will thus probably be made easier to us 
529	 La Let us do as you say Socrates 
531	 Soc Then which of the parts of virtue shall we select Must we
532	not select that to which the art of fighting in armour is supposed
533	to conduce And is not that generally thought to be courage 
535	 La Yes certainly 
537	 Soc Then Laches suppose that we first set about determining the
538	nature of courage and in the second place proceed to enquire how
539	the young men may attain this quality by the help of studies and
540	pursuits Tell me if you can what is courage 
542	 La Indeed Socrates I see no difficulty in answering he is a
543	man of courage who does not run away but remains at his post and
544	fights against the enemy there can be no mistake about that 
546	 Soc Very good Laches and yet I fear that I did not express myself
547	clearly and therefore you have answered not the question which I
548	intended to ask but another 
550	 La What do you mean Socrates 
552	 Soc I will endeavour to explain you would call a man courageous
553	who remains at his post and fights with the enemy 
555	 La Certainly I should 
557	 Soc And so should I but what would you say of another man who
558	fights flying instead of remaining 
560	 La How flying 
562	 Soc Why as the Scythians are said to fight flying as well as
563	pursuing and as Homer says in praise of the horses of Aeneas that
564	they knew how to pursue and fly quickly hither and thither and
565	he passes an encomium on Aeneas himself as having a knowledge of fear
566	or flight and calls him an author of fear or flight 
568	 La Yes Socrates and there Homer is right for he was speaking
569	of chariots as you were speaking of the Scythian cavalry who have
570	that way of fighting but the heavy armed Greek fights as I say 
571	remaining in his rank 
573	 Soc And yet Laches you must except the Lacedaemonians at Plataea 
574	who when they came upon the light shields of the Persians are said
575	not to have been willing to stand and fight and to have fled but
576	when the ranks of the Persians were broken they turned upon them like
577	cavalry and won the battle of Plataea 
579	 La That is true 
581	 Soc That was my meaning when I said that I was to blame in having
582	put my question badly and that this was the reason of your
583	answering badly For I meant to ask you not only about the courage
584	of heavy armed soldiers but about the courage of cavalry and every
585	other style of soldier and not only who are courageous in war but
586	who are courageous in perils by sea and who in disease or in
587	poverty or again in politics are courageous and not only who are
588	courageous against pain or fear but mighty to contend against desires
589	and pleasures either fixed in their rank or turning upon their enemy 
590	There is this sort of courage is there not Laches 
592	 La Certainly Socrates 
594	 Soc And all these are courageous but some have courage in
595	pleasures and some in pains some in desires and some in fears 
596	and some are cowards under the same conditions as I should imagine 
598	 La Very true 
600	 Soc Now I was asking about courage and cowardice in general And
601	I will begin with courage and once more ask What is that common
602	quality which is the same in all these cases and which is called
603	courage Do you now understand what I mean 
605	 La Not over well 
607	 Soc I mean this As I might ask what is that quality which is
608	called quickness and which is found in running in playing the
609	lyre in speaking in learning and in many other similar actions 
610	or rather which we possess in nearly every action that is worth
611	mentioning of arms legs mouth voice mind would you not apply
612	the term quickness to all of them 
614	 La Quite true 
616	 Soc And suppose I were to be asked by some one What is that common
617	quality Socrates which in all these uses of the word you call
618	quickness I should say the quality which accomplishes much in a
619	little time whether in running speaking or in any other sort of
620	action 
622	 La You would be quite correct 
624	 Soc And now Laches do you try and tell me in like manner What is
625	that common quality which is called courage and which includes all
626	the various uses of the term when applied both to pleasure and pain 
627	and in all the cases to which I was just now referring 
629	 La I should say that courage is a sort of endurance of the soul if
630	I am to speak of the universal nature which pervades them all 
632	 Soc But that is what we must do if we are to answer the question 
633	And yet I cannot say that every kind of endurance is in my opinion 
634	to be deemed courage Hear my reason I am sure Laches that you
635	would consider courage to be a very noble quality 
637	 La Most noble certainly 
639	 Soc And you would say that a wise endurance is also good and noble 
641	 La Very noble 
643	 Soc But what would you say of a foolish endurance Is not that 
644	on the other hand to be regarded as evil and hurtful 
646	 La True 
648	 Soc And is anything noble which is evil and hurtful 
650	 La I ought not to say that Socrates 
652	 Soc Then you would not admit that sort of endurance to be
653	courage for it is not noble but courage is noble 
655	 La You are right 
657	 Soc Then according to you only the wise endurance is courage 
659	 La True 
661	 Soc But as to the epithet wise wise in what In all things small
662	as well as great For example if a man shows the quality of endurance
663	in spending his money wisely knowing that by spending he will acquire
664	more in the end do you call him courageous 
666	 La Assuredly not 
668	 Soc Or for example if a man is a physician and his son or
669	some patient of his has inflammation of the lungs and begs that he
670	may be allowed to eat or drink something and the other is firm and
671	refuses is that courage 
673	 La No that is not courage at all any more than the last 
675	 Soc Again take the case of one who endures in war and is
676	willing to fight and wisely calculates and knows that others will
677	help him and that there will be fewer and inferior men against him
678	than there are with him and suppose that he has also advantages of
679	position would you say of such a one who endures with all this wisdom
680	and preparation that he or some man in the opposing army who is in
681	the opposite circumstances to these and yet endures and remains at his
682	post is the braver 
684	 La I should say that the latter Socrates was the braver 
686	 Soc But surely this is a foolish endurance in comparison with the
687	other 
689	 La That is true 
691	 Soc Then you would say that he who in an engagement of cavalry
692	endures having the knowledge of horsemanship is not so courageous as
693	he who endures having no such knowledge 
695	 La So I should say 
697	 Soc And he who endures having a knowledge of the use of the sling 
698	or the bow or of any other art is not so courageous as he who
699	endures not having such a knowledge 
701	 La True 
703	 Soc And he who descends into a well and dives and holds out in
704	this or any similar action having no knowledge of diving or the
705	like is as you would say more courageous than those who have this
706	knowledge 
708	 La Why Socrates what else can a man say 
710	 Soc Nothing if that be what he thinks 
712	 La But that is what I do think 
714	 Soc And yet men who thus run risks and endure are foolish 
715	Laches in comparison of those who do the same things having the
716	skill to do them 
718	 La That is true 
720	 Soc But foolish boldness and endurance appeared before to be base
721	and hurtful to us 
723	 La Quite true 
725	 Soc Whereas courage was acknowledged to be a noble quality 
727	 La True 
729	 Soc And now on the contrary we are saying that the foolish
730	endurance which was before held in dishonour is courage 
732	 La Very true 
734	 Soc And are we right in saying so 
736	 La Indeed Socrates I am sure that we are not right 
738	 Soc Then according to your statement you and I Laches are not
739	attuned to the Dorian mode which is a harmony of words and deeds for
740	our deeds are not in accordance with our words Any one would say that
741	we had courage who saw us in action but not I imagine he who
742	heard us talking about courage just now 
744	 La That is most true 
746	 Soc And is this condition of ours satisfactory 
748	 La Quite the reverse 
750	 Soc Suppose however that we admit the principle of which we are
751	speaking to a certain extent 
753	 La To what extent and what principle do you mean 
755	 Soc The principle of endurance We too must endure and persevere in
756	the enquiry and then courage will not laugh at our faintheartedness
757	in searching for courage which after all may very likely be
758	endurance 
760	 La I am ready to go on Socrates and yet I am unused to
761	investigations of this sort But the spirit of controversy has been
762	aroused in me by what has been said and I am really grieved at
763	being thus unable to express my meaning For I fancy that I do know
764	the nature of courage but somehow or other she has slipped away
765	from me and I cannot get hold of her and tell her nature 
767	 Soc But my dear friend should not the good sportsman follow the
768	track and not be lazy 
770	 La Certainly he should 
772	 Soc And shall we invite Nicias to join us he may be better at
773	the sport than we are What do you say 
775	 La I should like that 
777	 Soc Come then Nicias and do what you can to help your friends 
778	who are tossing on the waves of argument and at the last gasp you
779	see our extremity and may save us and also settle your own opinion 
780	if you will tell us what you think about courage 
782	 Nic I have been thinking Socrates that you and Laches are not
783	defining courage in the right way for you have forgotten an excellent
784	saying which I have heard from your own lips 
786	 Soc What is it Nicias 
788	 Nic I have often heard you say that Every man is good in that in
789	which he is wise and bad in that in which he is unwise 
791	 Soc That is certainly true Nicias 
793	 Nic And therefore if the brave man is good he is also wise 
795	 Soc Do you hear him Laches 
797	 La Yes I hear him but I do not very well understand him 
799	 Soc I think that I understand him and he appears to me to mean
800	that courage is a sort of wisdom 
802	 La What can he possibly mean Socrates 
804	 Soc That is a question which you must ask of himself 
806	 La Yes 
808	 Soc Tell him then Nicias what you mean by this wisdom for you
809	surely do not mean the wisdom which plays the flute 
811	 Nic Certainly not 
813	 Soc Nor the wisdom which plays the lyre 
815	 Nic No 
817	 Soc But what is this knowledge then and of what 
819	 La I think that you put the question to him very well Socrates 
820	and I would like him to say what is the nature of this knowledge or
821	wisdom 
823	 Nic I mean to say Laches that courage is the knowledge of that
824	which inspires fear or confidence in war or in anything 
826	 La How strangely he is talking Socrates 
828	 Soc Why do you say so Laches 
830	 La Why surely courage is one thing and wisdom another 
832	 Soc That is just what Nicias denies 
834	 La Yes that is what he denies but he is so 
836	 Soc Suppose that we instruct instead of abusing him 
838	 Nic Laches does not want to instruct me Socrates but having
839	been proved to be talking nonsense himself he wants to prove that I
840	have been doing the same 
842	 La Very true Nicias and you are talking nonsense as I shall
843	endeavour to show Let me ask you a question Do not physicians know
844	the dangers of disease or do the courageous know them or are the
845	physicians the same as the courageous 
847	 Nic Not at all 
849	 La No more than the husbandmen who know the dangers of husbandry 
850	or than other craftsmen who have a knowledge of that which inspires
851	them with fear or confidence in their own arts and yet they are not
852	courageous a whit the more for that 
854	 Soc What is Laches saying Nicias He appears to be saying
855	something of importance 
857	 Nic Yes he is saying something but it is not true 
859	 Soc How so 
861	 Nic Why because he does not see that the physician s knowledge
862	only extends to the nature of health and disease he can tell the sick
863	man no more than this Do you imagine Laches that the physician
864	knows whether health or disease is the more terrible to a man Had not
865	many a man better never get up from a sick bed I should like to
866	know whether you think that life is always better than death May
867	not death often be the better of the two 
869	 La Yes certainly so in my opinion 
871	 Nic And do you think that the same things are terrible to those who
872	had better die and to those who had better live 
874	 La Certainly not 
876	 Nic And do you suppose that the physician or any other artist knows
877	this or any one indeed except he who is skilled in the grounds of
878	fear and hope And him I call the courageous 
880	 Soc Do you understand his meaning Laches 
882	 La Yes I suppose that in his way of speaking the soothsayers are
883	courageous For who but one of them can know to whom to die or to live
884	is better And yet Nicias would you allow that you are yourself a
885	soothsayer or are you neither a soothsayer nor courageous 
887	 Nic What do you mean to say that the soothsayer ought to know
888	the grounds of hope or fear 
890	 La Indeed I do who but he 
892	 Nic Much rather I should say he of whom I speak for the soothsayer
893	ought to know only the signs of things that are about to come to pass 
894	whether death or disease or loss of property or victory or defeat
895	in war or in any sort of contest but to whom the suffering or not
896	suffering of these things will be for the best can no more be decided
897	by the soothsayer than by one who is no soothsayer 
899	 La I cannot understand what Nicias would be at Socrates for he
900	represents the courageous man as neither a soothsayer nor a
901	physician nor in any other character unless he means to say that
902	he is a god My opinion is that he does not like honestly to confess
903	that he is talking nonsense but that he shuffles up and down in order
904	to conceal the difficulty into which he has got himself You and I 
905	Socrates might have practised a similar shuffle just now if we had
906	only wanted to avoid the appearance of inconsistency And if we had
907	been arguing in a court of law there might have been reason in so
908	doing but why should a man deck himself out with vain words at a
909	meeting of friends such as this 
911	 Soc I quite agree with you Laches that he should not But perhaps
912	Nicias is serious and not merely talking for the sake of talking Let
913	us ask him just to explain what he means and if he has reason on
914	his side we will agree with him if not we will instruct him 
916	 La Do you Socrates if you like ask him I think that I have
917	asked enough 
919	 Soc I do not see why I should not and my question will do for both
920	of us 
922	 La Very good 
924	 Soc Then tell me Nicias or rather tell us for Laches and I are
925	partners in the argument Do you mean to affirm that courage is the
926	knowledge of the grounds of hope and fear 
928	 Nic I do 
930	 Soc And not every man has this knowledge the physician and the
931	soothsayer have it not and they will not be courageous unless they
932	acquire it that is what you were saying 
934	 Nic I was 
936	 Soc Then this is certainly not a thing which every pig would
937	know as the proverb says and therefore he could not be courageous 
939	 Nic I think not 
941	 Soc Clearly not Nicias not even such a big pig as the Crommyonian
942	sow would be called by you courageous And this I say not as a joke 
943	but because I think that he who assents to your doctrine that courage
944	is the knowledge of the grounds of fear and hope cannot allow that
945	any wild beast is courageous unless he admits that a lion or a
946	leopard or perhaps a boar or any other animal has such a degree
947	of wisdom that he knows things which but a few human beings ever
948	know by reason of their difficulty He who takes your view of
949	courage must affirm that a lion and a stag and a bull and a monkey 
950	have equally little pretensions to courage 
952	 La Capital Socrates by the gods that is truly good And I
953	hope Nicias that you will tell us whether these animals which we
954	all admit to be courageous are really wiser than mankind or
955	whether you will have the boldness in the face of universal
956	opinion to deny their courage 
958	 Nic Why Laches I do not call animals or any other things which
959	have no fear of dangers because they are ignorant of them 
960	courageous but only fearless and senseless Do you imagine that I
961	should call little children courageous which fear no dangers
962	because they know none There is a difference to my way of
963	thinking between fearlessness and courage I am of opinion that
964	thoughtful courage is a quality possessed by very few but that
965	rashness and boldness and fearlessness which has no forethought are
966	very common qualities possessed by many men many women many
967	children many animals And you and men in general call by the
968	term courageous actions which I call rash my courageous actions are
969	wise actions 
971	 La Behold Socrates how admirably as he thinks he dresses
972	himself out in words while seeking to deprive of the honour of
973	courage those whom all the world acknowledges to be courageous 
975	 Nic Not so Laches but do not be alarmed for I am quite willing
976	to say of you and also of Lamachus and of many other Athenians 
977	that you are courageous and therefore wise 
979	 La I could answer that but I would not have you cast in my teeth
980	that I am a haughty Aexonian 
982	 Soc Do not answer him Laches I rather fancy that you are not
983	aware of the source from which his wisdom is derived He has got all
984	this from my friend Damon and Damon is always with Prodicus who 
985	of all the Sophists is considered to be the best puller to pieces
986	of words of this sort 
988	 La Yes Socrates and the examination of such niceties is a much
989	more suitable employment for a Sophist than for a great statesman whom
990	the city chooses to preside over her 
992	 Soc Yes my sweet friend but a great statesman is likely to have a
993	great intelligence And I think that the view which is implied in
994	Nicias definition of courage is worthy of examination 
996	 La Then examine for yourself Socrates 
998	 Soc That is what I am going to do my dear friend Do not however 
999	suppose I shall let you out of the partnership for I shall expect you
1000	to apply your mind and join with me in the consideration of the
1001	question 
1003	 La I will if you think that I ought 
1005	 Soc Yes I do but I must beg of you Nicias to begin again You
1006	remember that we originally considered courage to be a part of virtue 
1008	 Nic Very true 
1010	 Soc And you yourself said that it was a part and there were many
1011	other parts all of which taken together are called virtue 
1013	 Nic Certainly 
1015	 Soc Do you agree with me about the parts For I say that justice 
1016	temperance and the like are all of them parts of virtue as well as
1017	courage Would you not say the same 
1019	 Nic Certainly 
1021	 Soc Well then so far we are agreed And now let us proceed a step 
1022	and try to arrive at a similar agreement about the fearful and the
1023	hopeful I do not want you to be thinking one thing and myself
1024	another Let me then tell you my own opinion and if I am wrong you
1025	shall set me in my opinion the terrible and the are the things which
1026	do or do not create fear and fear is not of the present nor of the
1027	past but is of future and expected evil Do you not agree to that 
1028	Laches 
1030	 La Yes Socrates entirely 
1032	 Soc That is my view Nicias the terrible things as I should
1033	say are the evils which are future and the hopeful are the good or
1034	not evil things which are future Do you or do you not agree with me 
1036	 Nic I agree 
1038	 Soc And the knowledge of these things you call courage 
1040	 Nic Precisely 
1042	 Soc And now let me see whether you agree with Laches and myself
1043	as to a third point 
1045	 Nic What is that 
1047	 Soc I will tell you He and I have a notion that there is not one
1048	knowledge or science of the past another of the present a third of
1049	what is likely to be best and what will be best in the future but
1050	that of all three there is one science only for example there is one
1051	science of medicine which is concerned with the inspection of health
1052	equally in all times present past and future and one science of
1053	husbandry in like manner which is concerned with the productions of
1054	the earth in all times As to the art of the general you yourselves
1055	will be my witnesses that he has an excellent foreknowledge of the
1056	future and that he claims to be the master and not the servant of the
1057	soothsayer because he knows better what is happening or is likely
1058	to happen in war and accordingly the law places the soothsayer
1059	under the general and not the general under the soothsayer Am I
1060	not correct in saying so Laches 
1062	 La Quite correct 
1064	 Soc And do you Nicias also acknowledge that the same science
1065	has understanding of the same things whether future present or
1066	past 
1068	 Nic Yes indeed Socrates that is my opinion 
1070	 Soc And courage my friend is as you say a knowledge of the
1071	fearful and of the hopeful 
1073	 Nic Yes 
1075	 Soc And the fearful and the hopeful are admitted to be future
1076	goods and future evils 
1078	 Nic True 
1080	 Soc And the same science has to do with the same things in the
1081	future or at any time 
1083	 Nic That is true 
1085	 Soc Then courage is not the science which is concerned with the
1086	fearful and hopeful for they are future only courage like the other
1087	sciences is concerned not only with good and evil of the future 
1088	but of the present and past and of any time 
1090	 Nic That as I suppose is true 
1092	 Soc Then the answer which you have given Nicias includes only a
1093	third part of courage but our question extended to the whole nature
1094	of courage and according to your view that is according to your
1095	present view courage is not only the knowledge of the hopeful and the
1096	fearful but seems to include nearly every good and evil without
1097	reference to time What do you say to that alteration in your
1098	statement 
1100	 Nic I agree Socrates 
1102	 Soc But then my dear friend if a man knew all good and evil 
1103	and how they are and have been and will be produced would he not
1104	be perfect and wanting in no virtue whether justice or
1105	temperance or holiness He would possess them all and he would
1106	know which were dangers and which were not and guard against them
1107	whether they were supernatural or natural and he would provide the
1108	good as he would know how to deal both with gods or men 
1110	 Nic I think Socrates that there is a great deal of truth in
1111	what you say 
1113	 Soc But then Nicias courage according to this new definition
1114	of yours instead of being a part of virtue only will be all virtue 
1116	 Nic It would seem so 
1118	 Soc But we were saying that courage is one of the parts of virtue 
1120	 Nic Yes that was what we were saying 
1122	 Soc And that is in contradiction with our present view 
1124	 Nic That appears to be the case 
1126	 Soc Then Nicias we have not discovered what courage is 
1128	 Nic We have not 
1130	 La And yet friend Nicias l imagined that you would have made the
1131	discovery when you were so contemptuous of the answers which I made
1132	to Socrates I had very great hopes that you would have been
1133	enlightened by the wisdom of Damon 
1135	 Nic I perceive Laches that you think nothing of having
1136	displayed your ignorance of the nature of courage but you look only
1137	to see whether I have not made a similar display and if we are both
1138	equally ignorant of the things which a man who is good for anything
1139	should know that I suppose will be of no consequence You certainly
1140	appear to me very like the rest of the world looking at your
1141	neighbour and not at yourself I am of opinion that enough has been
1142	said on the subject which we have been discussing and if anything has
1143	been imperfectly said that may be hereafter corrected by the help
1144	of Damon whom you think to laugh down although you have never seen
1145	him and with the help of others And when I am satisfied myself I
1146	will freely impart my satisfaction to you for I think that you are
1147	very much in want of knowledge 
1149	 La You are a philosopher Nicias of that I am aware 
1150	nevertheless I would recommend Lysimachus and Melesias not to take you
1151	and me as advisers about the education of their children but as I
1152	said at first they should ask Socrates and not let him off if my own
1153	sons were old enough I would have asked him myself 
1155	 Nic To that I quite agree if Socrates is willing to take them
1156	under his charge I should not wish for any one else to be the tutor
1157	of Niceratus But I observe that when I mention the matter to him he
1158	recommends to me some other tutor and refuses himself Perhaps he
1159	may be more ready to listen to you Lysimachus 
1161	 Lys He ought Nicias for certainly I would do things for him which
1162	I would not do for many others What do you say Socrates will you
1163	comply And are you ready to give assistance in the improvement of the
1164	youths 
1166	 Soc Indeed Lysimachus I should be very wrong in refusing to aid
1167	in the improvement of anybody And if I had shown in this conversation
1168	that I had a knowledge which Nicias and Laches have not then I
1169	admit that you would be right in inviting me to perform this duty but
1170	as we are all in the same perplexity why should one of us be
1171	preferred to another I certainly think that no one should and
1172	under these circumstances let me offer you a piece of advice and
1173	this need not go further than ourselves I maintain my friends that
1174	every one of us should seek out the best teacher whom he can find 
1175	first for ourselves who are greatly in need of one and then for
1176	the youth regardless of expense or anything But I cannot advise that
1177	we remain as we are And if any one laughs at us for going to school
1178	at our age I would quote to them the authority of Homer who says 
1179	that
1181	 Modesty is not good for a needy man 
1183	Let us then regardless of what may be said of us make the education
1184	of the youths our own education 
1186	 Lys I like your proposal Socrates and as I am the oldest I am
1187	also the most eager to go to school with the boys Let me beg a favour
1188	of you Come to my house to morrow at dawn and we will advise about
1189	these matters For the present let us make an end of the
1190	conversation 
1192	 Soc I will come to you to morrow Lysimachus as you propose God
1193	willing 
1195	 THE END
