10	 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE CRITIAS HERMOCRATES TIMAEUS SOCRATES
12	 Timaeus How thankful I am Socrates that I have arrived at last 
13	and like a weary traveller after a long journey may be at rest 
14	And I pray the being who always was of old and has now been by me
15	revealed to grant that my words may endure in so far as they have
16	been spoken truly and acceptably to him but if unintentionally I have
17	said anything wrong I pray that he will impose upon me a just
18	retribution and the just retribution of him who errs is that he
19	should be set right Wishing then to speak truly in future
20	concerning the generation of the gods I pray him to give me
21	knowledge which of all medicines is the most perfect and best And
22	now having offered my prayer I deliver up the argument to Critias who
23	is to speak next according to our agreement 
25	 Critias And I Timaeus accept the trust and as you at first
26	said that you were going to speak of high matters and begged that
27	some forbearance might be shown to you I too ask the same or
28	greater forbearance for what I am about to say And although I very
29	well know that my request may appear to be somewhat and
30	discourteous I must make it nevertheless For will any man of sense
31	deny that you have spoken well I can only attempt to show that I
32	ought to have more indulgence than you because my theme is more
33	difficult and I shall argue that to seem to speak well of the gods to
34	men is far easier than to speak well of men to men for the
35	inexperience and utter ignorance of his hearers about any subject is a
36	great assistance to him who has to speak of it and we know how
37	ignorant we are concerning the gods But I should like to make my
38	meaning clearer if Timaeus you will follow me All that is said by
39	any of us can only be imitation and representation For if we consider
40	the likenesses which painters make of bodies divine and heavenly 
41	and the different degrees of gratification with which the eye of the
42	spectator receives them we shall see that we are satisfied with the
43	artist who is able in any degree to imitate the earth and its
44	mountains and the rivers and the woods and the universe and the
45	things that are and move therein and further that knowing nothing
46	precise about such matters we do not examine or analyze the painting 
47	all that is required is a sort of indistinct and deceptive mode of
48	shadowing them forth But when a person endeavours to paint the
49	human form we are quick at finding out defects and our familiar
50	knowledge makes us severe judges of any one who does not render
51	every point of similarity And we may observe the same thing to happen
52	in discourse we are satisfied with a picture of divine and heavenly
53	things which has very little likeness to them but we are more precise
54	in our criticism of mortal and human things Wherefore if at the
55	moment of speaking I cannot suitably express my meaning you must
56	excuse me considering that to form approved likenesses of human
57	things is the reverse of easy This is what I want to suggest to
58	you and at the same time to beg Socrates that I may have not
59	less but more indulgence conceded to me in what I am about to say 
60	Which favour if I am right in asking I hope that you will be ready
61	to grant 
63	 Socrates Certainly Critias we will grant your request and we
64	will grant the same by anticipation to Hermocrates as well as to
65	you and Timaeus for I have no doubt that when his turn comes a little
66	while hence he will make the same request which you have made In
67	order then that he may provide himself with a fresh beginning and
68	not be compelled to say the same things over again let him understand
69	that the indulgence is already extended by anticipation to him And
70	now friend Critias I will announce to you the judgment of the
71	theatre They are of opinion that the last performer was wonderfully
72	successful and that you will need a great deal of indulgence before
73	you will be able to take his place 
75	 Hermocrates The warning Socrates which you have addressed to him 
76	I must also take to myself But remember Critias that faint heart
77	never yet raised a trophy and therefore you must go and attack the
78	argument like a man First invoke Apollo and the Muses and then let
79	us hear you sound the praises and show forth the virtues of your
80	ancient citizens 
82	 Crit Friend Hermocrates you who are stationed last and have
83	another in front of you have not lost heart as yet the gravity of
84	the situation will soon be revealed to you meanwhile I accept your
85	exhortations and encouragements But besides the gods and goddesses
86	whom you have mentioned I would specially invoke Mnemosyne for all
87	the important part of my discourse is dependent on her favour and
88	if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said by the priests
89	and brought hither by Solon I doubt not that I shall satisfy the
90	requirements of this theatre And now making no more excuses I
91	will proceed 
93	 Let me begin by observing first of all that nine thousand was the
94	sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have
95	taken place between those who dwelt outside the Pillars of Heracles
96	and all who dwelt within them this war I am going to describe Of the
97	combatants on the one side the city of Athens was reported to have
98	been the leader and to have fought out the war the combatants on
99	the other side were commanded by the kings of Atlantis which as
100	was saying was an island greater in extent than Libya and Asia and
101	when afterwards sunk by an earthquake became an impassable barrier of
102	mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of the ocean The
103	progress of the history will unfold the various nations of
104	barbarians and families of Hellenes which then existed as they
105	successively appear on the scene but I must describe first of all
106	Athenians of that day and their enemies who fought with them and
107	then the respective powers and governments of the two kingdoms Let us
108	give the precedence to Athens 
110	 In the days of old the gods had the whole earth distributed among
111	them by allotment There was no quarrelling for you cannot rightly
112	suppose that the gods did not know what was proper for each of them to
113	have or knowing this that they would seek to procure for themselves
114	by contention that which more properly belonged to others They all of
115	them by just apportionment obtained what they wanted and peopled
116	their own districts and when they had peopled them they tended us 
117	their nurselings and possessions as shepherds tend their flocks 
118	excepting only that they did not use blows or bodily force as
119	shepherds do but governed us like pilots from the stern of the
120	vessel which is an easy way of guiding animals holding our souls
121	by the rudder of persuasion according to their own pleasure thus
122	did they guide all mortal creatures Now different gods had their
123	allotments in different places which they set in order Hephaestus and
124	Athene who were brother and sister and sprang from the same
125	father having a common nature and being united also in the love of
126	philosophy and art both obtained as their common portion this land 
127	which was naturally adapted for wisdom and virtue and there they
128	implanted brave children of the soil and put into their minds the
129	order of government their names are preserved but their actions have
130	disappeared by reason of the destruction of those who received the
131	tradition and the lapse of ages For when there were any survivors 
132	as I have already said they were men who dwelt in the mountains 
133	and they were ignorant of the art of writing and had heard only the
134	names of the chiefs of the land but very little about their
135	actions The names they were willing enough to give to their children 
136	but the virtues and the laws of their predecessors they knew only
137	by obscure traditions and as they themselves and their children
138	lacked for many generations the necessaries of life they directed
139	their attention to the supply of their wants and of them they
140	conversed to the neglect of events that had happened in times long
141	past for mythology and the enquiry into antiquity are first
142	introduced into cities when they begin to have leisure and when
143	they see that the necessaries of life have already been provided 
144	but not before And this is reason why the names of the ancients
145	have been preserved to us and not their actions This I infer
146	because Solon said that the priests in their narrative of that war
147	mentioned most of the names which are recorded prior to the time of
148	Theseus such as Cecrops and Erechtheus and Erichthonius and
149	Erysichthon and the names of the women in like manner Moreover 
150	since military pursuits were then common to men and women the men
151	of those days in accordance with the custom of the time set up a
152	figure and image of the goddess in full armour to be a testimony that
153	all animals which associate together male as well as female may 
154	if they please practise in common the virtue which belongs to them
155	without distinction of sex 
157	 Now the country was inhabited in those days by various classes of
158	citizens there were artisans and there were husbandmen and there
159	was also a warrior class originally set apart by divine men The
160	latter dwelt by themselves and had all things suitable for nurture
161	and education neither had any of them anything of their own but they
162	regarded all that they had as common property nor did they claim to
163	receive of the other citizens anything more than their necessary food 
164	And they practised all the pursuits which we yesterday described as
165	those of our imaginary guardians Concerning the country the
166	Egyptian priests said what is not only probable but manifestly true 
167	that the boundaries were in those days fixed by the Isthmus and
168	that in the direction of the continent they extended as far as the
169	heights of Cithaeron and Parnes the boundary line came down in the
170	direction of the sea having the district of Oropus on the right 
171	and with the river Asopus as the limit on the left The land was the
172	best in the world and was therefore able in those days to support a
173	vast army raised from the surrounding people Even the remnant of
174	Attica which now exists may compare with any region in the world for
175	the variety and excellence of its fruits and the suitableness of its
176	pastures to every sort of animal which proves what I am saying but
177	in those days the country was fair as now and yielded far more
178	abundant produce How shall I establish my words and what part of
179	it can be truly called a remnant of the land that then was The
180	whole country is only a long promontory extending far into the sea
181	away from the rest of the continent while the surrounding basin of
182	the sea is everywhere deep in the neighbourhood of the shore Many
183	great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years for
184	that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which
185	I am speaking and during all this time and through so many changes 
186	there has never been any considerable accumulation of the soil
187	coming down from the mountains as in other places but the earth
188	has fallen away all round and sunk out of sight The consequence is 
189	that in comparison of what then was there are remaining only the
190	bones of the wasted body as they may be called as in the case of
191	small islands all the richer and softer parts of the soil having
192	fallen away and the mere skeleton of the land being left But in
193	the primitive state of the country its mountains were high hills
194	covered with soil and the plains as they are termed by us of
195	Phelleus were full of rich earth and there was abundance of wood in
196	the mountains Of this last the traces still remain for although some
197	of the mountains now only afford sustenance to bees not so very
198	long ago there were still to be seen roofs of timber cut from trees
199	growing there which were of a size sufficient to cover the largest
200	houses and there were many other high trees cultivated by man and
201	bearing abundance of food for cattle Moreover the land reaped the
202	benefit of the annual rainfall not as now losing the water which
203	flows off the bare earth into the sea but having an abundant
204	supply in all places and receiving it into herself and treasuring
205	it up in the close clay soil it let off into the hollows the
206	streams which it absorbed from the heights providing everywhere
207	abundant fountains and rivers of which there may still be observed
208	sacred memorials in places where fountains once existed and this
209	proves the truth of what I am saying 
211	 Such was the natural state of the country which was cultivated 
212	as we may well believe by true husbandmen who made husbandry their
213	business and were lovers of honour and of a noble nature and had
214	a soil the best in the world and abundance of water and in the
215	heaven above an excellently attempered climate Now the city in
216	those days was arranged on this wise In the first place the Acropolis
217	was not as now For the fact is that a single night of excessive
218	rain washed away the earth and laid bare the rock at the same time
219	there were earthquakes and then occurred the extraordinary
220	inundation which was the third before the great destruction of
221	Deucalion But in primitive times the hill of the Acropolis extended
222	to the Eridanus and Ilissus and included the Pnyx on one side and
223	the Lycabettus as a boundary on the opposite side to the Pnyx and was
224	all well covered with soil and level at the top except in one or two
225	places Outside the Acropolis and under the sides of the hill there
226	dwelt artisans and such of the husbandmen as were tilling the
227	ground near the warrior class dwelt by themselves around the
228	temples of Athene and Hephaestus at the summit which moreover they
229	had enclosed with a single fence like the garden of a single house On
230	the north side they had dwellings in common and had erected halls
231	for dining in winter and had all the buildings which they needed
232	for their common life besides temples but there was no adorning of
233	them with gold and silver for they made no use of these for any
234	purpose they took a middle course between meanness and ostentation 
235	and built modest houses in which they and their children s children
236	grew old and they handed them down to others who were like
237	themselves always the same But in summer time they left their
238	gardens and gymnasia and dining halls and then the southern side of
239	the hill was made use of by them for the same purpose Where the
240	Acropolis now is there was a fountain which was choked by the
241	earthquake and has left only the few small streams which still
242	exist in the vicinity but in those days the fountain gave an abundant
243	supply of water for all and of suitable temperature in summer and in
244	winter This is how they dwelt being the guardians of their own
245	citizens and the leaders of the Hellenes who were their willing
246	followers And they took care to preserve the same number of men and
247	women through all time being so many as were required for warlike
248	purposes then as now that is to say about twenty thousand Such were
249	the ancient Athenians and after this manner they righteously
250	administered their own land and the rest of Hellas they were renowned
251	all over Europe and Asia for the beauty of their persons and for the
252	many virtues of their souls and of all men who lived in those days
253	they were the most illustrious And next if I have not forgotten what
254	I heard when I was a child I will impart to you the character and
255	origin of their adversaries For friends should not keep their stories
256	to themselves but have them in common 
258	 Yet before proceeding further in the narrative I ought to warn
259	you that you must not be surprised if you should perhaps hear
260	Hellenic names given to foreigners I will tell you the reason of
261	this Solon who was intending to use the tale for his poem 
262	enquired into the meaning of the names and found that the early
263	Egyptians in writing them down had translated them into their own
264	language and he recovered the meaning of the several names and when
265	copying them out again translated them into our language My
266	great grandfather Dropides had the original writing which is
267	still in my possession and was carefully studied by me when I was a
268	child Therefore if you hear names such as are used in this country 
269	you must not be surprised for I have told how they came to be
270	introduced The tale which was of great length began as follows 
272	 I have before remarked in speaking of the allotments of the gods 
273	that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in
274	extent and made for themselves temples and instituted sacrifices And
275	Poseidon receiving for his lot the island of Atlantis begat children
276	by a mortal woman and settled them in a part of the island which I
277	will describe Looking towards the sea but in the centre of the whole
278	island there was a plain which is said to have been the fairest of
279	all plains and very fertile Near the plain again and also in the
280	centre of the island at a distance of about fifty stadia there was
281	a mountain not very high on any side 
283	 In this mountain there dwelt one of the earth born primeval men of
284	that country whose name was Evenor and he had a wife named Leucippe 
285	and they had an only daughter who was called Cleito The maiden had
286	already reached womanhood when her father and mother died Poseidon
287	fell in love with her and had intercourse with her and breaking the
288	ground inclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round making
289	alternate zones of sea and land larger and smaller encircling one
290	another there were two of land and three of water which he turned as
291	with a lathe each having its circumference equidistant every way from
292	the centre so that no man could get to the island for ships and
293	voyages were not as yet He himself being a god found no
294	difficulty in making special arrangements for the centre island 
295	bringing up two springs of water from beneath the earth one of warm
296	water and the other of cold and making every variety of food to
297	spring up abundantly from the soil He also begat and brought up
298	five pairs of twin male children and dividing the island of
299	Atlantis into ten portions he gave to the first born of the eldest
300	pair his mother s dwelling and the surrounding allotment which was
301	the largest and best and made him king over the rest the others he
302	made princes and gave them rule over many men and a large territory 
303	And he named them all the eldest who was the first king he named
304	Atlas and after him the whole island and the ocean were called
305	Atlantic To his twin brother who was born after him and obtained as
306	his lot the extremity of the island towards the Pillars of Heracles 
307	facing the country which is now called the region of Gades in that
308	part of the world he gave the name which in the Hellenic language
309	is Eumelus in the language of the country which is named after him 
310	Gadeirus Of the second pair of twins he called one Ampheres and
311	the other Evaemon To the elder of the third pair of twins he gave the
312	name Mneseus and Autochthon to the one who followed him Of the
313	fourth pair of twins he called the elder Elasippus and the younger
314	Mestor And of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name of
315	Azaes and to the younger that of Diaprepes All these and their
316	descendants for many generations were the inhabitants and rulers of
317	divers islands in the open sea and also as has been already said 
318	they held sway in our direction over the country within the Pillars as
319	far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia 
321	 Now Atlas had a numerous and honourable family and they retained
322	the kingdom the eldest son handing it on to his eldest for many
323	generations and they had such an amount of wealth as was never before
324	possessed by kings and potentates and is not likely ever to be again 
325	and they were furnished with everything which they needed both in the
326	city and country For because of the greatness of their empire many
327	things were brought to them from foreign countries and the island
328	itself provided most of what was required by them for the uses of
329	life In the first place they dug out of the earth whatever was to be
330	found there solid as well as fusile and that which is now only a
331	name and was then something more than a name orichalcum was dug
332	out of the earth in many parts of the island being more precious in
333	those days than anything except gold There was an abundance of wood
334	for carpenter s work and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild
335	animals Moreover there were a great number of elephants in the
336	island for as there was provision for all other sorts of animals 
337	both for those which live in lakes and marshes and rivers and also
338	for those which live in mountains and on plains so there was for
339	the animal which is the largest and most voracious of all Also
340	whatever fragrant things there now are in the earth whether roots or
341	herbage or woods or essences which distil from fruit and flower 
342	grew and thrived in that land also the fruit which admits of
343	cultivation both the dry sort which is given us for nourishment
344	and any other which we use for food we call them all by the common
345	name pulse and the fruits having a hard rind affording drinks and
346	meats and ointments and good store of chestnuts and the like which
347	furnish pleasure and amusement and are fruits which spoil with
348	keeping and the pleasant kinds of dessert with which we console
349	ourselves after dinner when we are tired of eating all these that
350	sacred island which then beheld the light of the sun brought forth
351	fair and wondrous and in infinite abundance With such blessings the
352	earth freely furnished them meanwhile they went on constructing their
353	temples and palaces and harbours and docks And they arranged the
354	whole country in the following manner 
356	 First of all they bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded the
357	ancient metropolis making a road to and from the royal palace And at
358	the very beginning they built the palace in the habitation of the
359	god and of their ancestors which they continued to ornament in
360	successive generations every king surpassing the one who went
361	before him to the utmost of his power until they made the building
362	a marvel to behold for size and for beauty And beginning from the sea
363	they bored a canal of three hundred feet in width and one hundred feet
364	in depth and fifty stadia in length which they carried through to the
365	outermost zone making a passage from the sea up to this which became
366	a harbour and leaving an opening sufficient to enable the largest
367	vessels to find ingress Moreover they divided at the bridges the
368	zones of land which parted the zones of sea leaving room for a single
369	trireme to pass out of one zone into another and they covered over
370	the channels so as to leave a way underneath for the ships for the
371	banks were raised considerably above the water Now the largest of the
372	zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was three stadia in
373	breadth and the zone of land which came next of equal breadth but
374	the next two zones the one of water the other of land were two
375	stadia and the one which surrounded the central island was a
376	stadium only in width The island in which the palace was situated had
377	a diameter of five stadia All this including the zones and the
378	bridge which was the sixth part of a stadium in width they
379	surrounded by a stone wall on every side placing towers and gates
380	on the bridges where the sea passed in The stone which was used in
381	the work they quarried from underneath the centre island and from
382	underneath the zones on the outer as well as the inner side One kind
383	was white another black and a third red and as they quarried 
384	they at the same time hollowed out double docks having roofs formed
385	out of the native rock Some of their buildings were simple but in
386	others they put together different stones varying the colour to
387	please the eye and to be a natural source of delight The entire
388	circuit of the wall which went round the outermost zone they covered
389	with a coating of brass and the circuit of the next wall they
390	coated with tin and the third which encompassed the citadel flashed
391	with the red light of orichalcum 
393	 The palaces in the interior of the citadel were constructed on
394	this wise in the centre was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and
395	Poseidon which remained inaccessible and was surrounded by an
396	enclosure of gold this was the spot where the family of the ten
397	princes first saw the light and thither the people annually brought
398	the fruits of the earth in their season from all the ten portions 
399	to be an offering to each of the ten Here was Poseidon s own temple
400	which was a stadium in length and half a stadium in width and of a
401	proportionate height having a strange barbaric appearance All the
402	outside of the temple with the exception of the pinnacles they
403	covered with silver and the pinnacles with gold In the interior of
404	the temple the roof was of ivory curiously wrought everywhere with
405	gold and silver and orichalcum and all the other parts the walls and
406	pillars and floor they coated with orichalcum In the temple they
407	placed statues of gold there was the god himself standing in a
408	chariot the charioteer of six winged horses and of such a size that he
409	touched the roof of the building with his head around him there
410	were a hundred Nereids riding on dolphins for such was thought to
411	be the number of them by the men of those days There were also in the
412	interior of the temple other images which had been dedicated by
413	private persons And around the temple on the outside were placed
414	statues of gold of all the descendants of the ten kings and of their
415	wives and there were many other great offerings of kings and of
416	private persons coming both from the city itself and from the foreign
417	cities over which they held sway There was an altar too which in
418	size and workmanship corresponded to this magnificence and the
419	palaces in like manner answered to the greatness of the kingdom
420	and the glory of the temple 
422	 In the next place they had fountains one of cold and another of
423	hot water in gracious plenty flowing and they were wonderfully
424	adapted for use by reason of the pleasantness and excellence of
425	their waters They constructed buildings about them and planted
426	suitable trees also they made cisterns some open to the heavens 
427	others roofed over to be used in winter as warm baths there were the
428	kings baths and the baths of private persons which were kept apart 
429	and there were separate baths for women and for horses and cattle 
430	and to each of them they gave as much adornment as was suitable Of
431	the water which ran off they carried some to the grove of Poseidon 
432	where were growing all manner of trees of wonderful height and beauty 
433	owing to the excellence of the soil while the remainder was
434	conveyed by aqueducts along the bridges to the outer circles and
435	there were many temples built and dedicated to many gods also gardens
436	and places of exercise some for men and others for horses in both of
437	the two islands formed by the zones and in the centre of the larger
438	of the two there was set apart a race course of a stadium in width 
439	and in length allowed to extend all round the island for horses to
440	race in Also there were guardhouses at intervals for the guards 
441	the more trusted of whom were appointed to keep watch in the lesser
442	zone which was nearer the Acropolis while the most trusted of all had
443	houses given them within the citadel near the persons of the kings 
444	The docks were full of triremes and naval stores and all things
445	were quite ready for use Enough of the plan of the royal palace 
447	 Leaving the palace and passing out across the three you came to a
448	wall which began at the sea and went all round this was everywhere
449	distant fifty stadia from the largest zone or harbour and enclosed
450	the whole the ends meeting at the mouth of the channel which led to
451	the sea The entire area was densely crowded with habitations and the
452	canal and the largest of the harbours were full of vessels and
453	merchants coming from all parts who from their numbers kept up a
454	multitudinous sound of human voices and din and clatter of all
455	sorts night and day 
457	 I have described the city and the environs of the ancient palace
458	nearly in the words of Solon and now I must endeavour to represent
459	the nature and arrangement of the rest of the land The whole
460	country was said by him to be very lofty and precipitous on the side
461	of the sea but the country immediately about and surrounding the city
462	was a level plain itself surrounded by mountains which descended
463	towards the sea it was smooth and even and of an oblong shape 
464	extending in one direction three thousand stadia but across the
465	centre inland it was two thousand stadia This part of the island
466	looked towards the south and was sheltered from the north The
467	surrounding mountains were celebrated for their number and size and
468	beauty far beyond any which still exist having in them also many
469	wealthy villages of country folk and rivers and lakes and meadows
470	supplying food enough for every animal wild or tame and much wood of
471	various sorts abundant for each and every kind of work 
473	 I will now describe the plain as it was fashioned by nature and
474	by the labours of many generations of kings through long ages It
475	was for the most part rectangular and oblong and where falling out of
476	the straight line followed the circular ditch The depth and width 
477	and length of this ditch were incredible and gave the impression that
478	a work of such extent in addition to so many others could never have
479	been artificial Nevertheless I must say what I was told It was
480	excavated to the depth of a hundred feet and its breadth was a
481	stadium everywhere it was carried round the whole of the plain and
482	was ten thousand stadia in length It received the streams which
483	came down from the mountains and winding round the plain and
484	meeting at the city was there let off into the sea Further inland 
485	likewise straight canals of a hundred feet in width were cut from
486	it through the plain and again let off into the ditch leading to
487	the sea these canals were at intervals of a hundred stadia and by
488	them they brought down the wood from the mountains to the city and
489	conveyed the fruits of the earth in ships cutting transverse passages
490	from one canal into another and to the city Twice in the year they
491	gathered the fruits of the earth in winter having the benefit of the
492	rains of heaven and in summer the water which the land supplied by
493	introducing streams from the canals 
495	 As to the population each of the lots in the plain had to find a
496	leader for the men who were fit for military service and the size
497	of a lot was a square of ten stadia each way and the total number
498	of all the lots was sixty thousand And of the inhabitants of the
499	mountains and of the rest of the country there was also a vast
500	multitude which was distributed among the lots and had leaders
501	assigned to them according to their districts and villages The leader
502	was required to furnish for the war the sixth portion of a
503	war chariot so as to make up a total of ten thousand chariots also
504	two horses and riders for them and a pair of chariot horses without a
505	seat accompanied by a horseman who could fight on foot carrying a
506	small shield and having a charioteer who stood behind the man at arms
507	to guide the two horses also he was bound to furnish two heavy armed
508	soldiers two slingers three stone shooters and three javelin men 
509	who were light armed and four sailors to make up the complement of
510	twelve hundred ships Such was the military order of the royal
511	city the order of the other nine governments varied and it would be
512	wearisome to recount their several differences 
514	 As to offices and honours the following was the arrangement from
515	the first Each of the ten kings in his own division and in his own
516	city had the absolute control of the citizens and in most cases 
517	of the laws punishing and slaying whomsoever he would Now the
518	order of precedence among them and their mutual relations were
519	regulated by the commands of Poseidon which the law had handed down 
520	These were inscribed by the first kings on a pillar of orichalcum 
521	which was situated in the middle of the island at the temple of
522	Poseidon whither the kings were gathered together every fifth and
523	every sixth year alternately thus giving equal honour to the odd
524	and to the even number And when they were gathered together they
525	consulted about their common interests and enquired if any one had
526	transgressed in anything and passed judgment and before they passed
527	judgment they gave their pledges to one another on this wise There
528	were bulls who had the range of the temple of Poseidon and the ten
529	kings being left alone in the temple after they had offered
530	prayers to the god that they might capture the victim which was
531	acceptable to him hunted the bulls without weapons but with staves
532	and nooses and the bull which they caught they led up to the pillar
533	and cut its throat over the top of it so that the blood fell upon
534	the sacred inscription Now on the pillar besides the laws there was
535	inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the disobedient When
536	therefore after slaying the bull in the accustomed manner they had
537	burnt its limbs they filled a bowl of wine and cast in a clot of
538	blood for each of them the rest of the victim they put in the fire 
539	after having purified the column all round Then they drew from the
540	bowl in golden cups and pouring a libation on the fire they swore
541	that they would judge according to the laws on the pillar and would
542	punish him who in any point had already transgressed them and that
543	for the future they would not if they could help offend against
544	the writing on the pillar and would neither command others nor
545	obey any ruler who commanded them to act otherwise than according
546	to the laws of their father Poseidon This was the prayer which each
547	of them offered up for himself and for his descendants at the same
548	time drinking and dedicating the cup out of which he drank in the
549	temple of the god and after they had supped and satisfied their
550	needs when darkness came on and the fire about the sacrifice was
551	cool all of them put on most beautiful azure robes and sitting on
552	the ground at night over the embers of the sacrifices by which
553	they had sworn and extinguishing all the fire about the temple 
554	they received and gave judgment if any of them had an accusation to
555	bring against any one and when they given judgment at daybreak
556	they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet and dedicated it
557	together with their robes to be a memorial 
559	 There were many special laws affecting the several kings inscribed
560	about the temples but the most important was the following They were
561	not to take up arms against one another and they were all to come
562	to the rescue if any one in any of their cities attempted to overthrow
563	the royal house like their ancestors they were to deliberate in
564	common about war and other matters giving the supremacy to the
565	descendants of Atlas And the king was not to have the power of life
566	and death over any of his kinsmen unless he had the assent of the
567	majority of the ten 
569	 Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island
570	of Atlantis and this he afterwards directed against our land for
571	the following reasons as tradition tells For many generations as
572	long as the divine nature lasted in them they were obedient to the
573	laws and well affectioned towards the god whose seed they were 
574	for they possessed true and in every way great spirits uniting
575	gentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life and in their
576	intercourse with one another They despised everything but virtue 
577	caring little for their present state of life and thinking lightly of
578	the possession of gold and other property which seemed only a
579	burden to them neither were they intoxicated by luxury nor did
580	wealth deprive them of their self control but they were sober and
581	saw clearly that all these goods are increased by virtue and
582	friendship with one another whereas by too great regard and respect
583	for them they are lost and friendship with them By such
584	reflections and by the continuance in them of a divine nature the
585	qualities which we have described grew and increased among them but
586	when the divine portion began to fade away and became diluted too
587	often and too much with the mortal admixture and the human nature got
588	the upper hand they then being unable to bear their fortune behaved
589	unseemly and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased for
590	they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts but to those who
591	had no eye to see the true happiness they appeared glorious and
592	blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and
593	unrighteous power Zeus the god of gods who rules according to
594	law and is able to see into such things perceiving that an
595	honourable race was in a woeful plight and wanting to inflict
596	punishment on them that they might be chastened and improve 
597	collected all the gods into their most holy habitation which being
598	placed in the centre of the world beholds all created things And
599	when he had called them together he spake as follows
