11	 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE SOCRATES who is the narrator MENEXENUS 
12	HIPPOTHALES LYSIS CTESIPPUS Scene A newly erected Palaestra
13	outside the walls of Athens 
15	 I was going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum intending to
16	take the outer road which is close under the wall When I came to the
17	postern gate of the city which is by the fountain of Panops I fell
18	in with Hippothales the son of Hieronymus and Ctesippus the
19	Paeanian and a company of young men who were standing with them 
20	Hippothales seeing me approach asked whence I came and whither I was
21	going 
23	 I am going I replied from the Academy straight to the Lyceum 
25	 Then come straight to us he said and put in here you may as well 
27	 Who are you I said and where am I to come 
29	 He showed me an enclosed space and an open door over against the
30	wall And there he said is the building at which we all meet and
31	a goodly company we are 
33	 And what is this building I asked and what sort of entertainment
34	have you 
36	 The building he replied is a newly erected Palaestra and the
37	entertainment is generally conversation to which you are welcome 
39	 Thank you I said and is there any teacher there 
41	 Yes he said your old friend and admirer Miccus 
43	 Indeed I replied he is a very eminent professor 
45	 Are you disposed he said to go with me and see them 
47	 Yes I said but I should like to know first what is expected of
48	me and who is the favourite among you 
50	 Some persons have one favourite Socrates and some another he
51	said 
53	 And who is yours I asked tell me that Hippothales 
55	 At this he blushed and I said to him O Hippothales thou son of
56	Hieronymus do not say that you are or that you are not in love the
57	confession is too late for I see that you are not only in love but
58	are already far gone in your love Simple and foolish as I am the
59	Gods have given me the power of understanding affections of this kind 
61	 Whereupon he blushed more and more 
63	 Ctesippus said I like to see you blushing Hippothales and
64	hesitating to tell Socrates the name when if he were with you but
65	for a very short time you would have plagued him to death by
66	talking about nothing else Indeed Socrates he has literally
67	deafened us and stopped our ears with the praises of Lysis and if he
68	is a little intoxicated there is every likelihood that we may have
69	our sleep murdered with a cry of Lysis His performances in prose
70	are bad enough but nothing at all in comparison with his verse and
71	when he drenches us with his poems and other compositions it is
72	really too bad and worse still is his manner of singing them to his
73	love he has a voice which is truly appalling and we cannot help
74	hearing him and now having a question put to him by you behold he is
75	blushing 
77	 Who is Lysis I said I suppose that he must be young for the
78	name does not recall any one to me 
80	 Why he said his father being a very well known man he retains his
81	patronymic and is not as yet commonly called by his own name but 
82	although you do not know his name I am sure that you must know his
83	face for that is quite enough to distinguish him 
85	 But tell me whose son he is I said 
87	 He is the eldest son of Democrates of the deme of Aexone 
89	 Ah Hippothales I said what a noble and really perfect love you
90	have found I wish that you would favour me with the exhibition
91	which you have been making to the rest of the company and then I
92	shall be able to judge whether you know what a lover ought to say
93	about his love either to the youth himself or to others 
95	 Nay Socrates he said you surely do not attach any importance to
96	what he is saying 
98	 Do you mean I said that you disown the love of the person whom
99	he says that you love 
101	 No but I deny that I make verses or address compositions to him 
103	 He is not in his right mind said Ctesippus he is talking nonsense 
104	and is stark mad 
106	 O Hippothales I said if you have ever made any verses or songs
107	in honour of your favourite I do not want to hear them but I want to
108	know the purport of them that I may be able to judge of your mode
109	of approaching your fair one 
111	 Ctesippus will be able to tell you he said for if as he avers 
112	the sound of my words is always dinning in his ears he must have a
113	very accurate knowledge and recollection of them 
115	 Yes indeed said Ctesippus I know only too well and very
116	ridiculous the tale is for although he is a lover and very devotedly
117	in love he has nothing particular to talk about to his beloved
118	which a child might not say Now is not that ridiculous He can only
119	speak of the wealth of Democrates which the whole city celebrates 
120	and grandfather Lysis and the other ancestors of the youth and their
121	stud of horses and their victory at the Pythian games and at the
122	Isthmus and at Nemea with four horses and single horses these are the
123	tales which he composes and repeats And there is greater twaddle
124	still Only the day before yesterday he made a poem in which he
125	described the entertainment of Heracles who was a connexion of the
126	family setting forth how in virtue of this relationship he was
127	hospitably received by an ancestor of Lysis this ancestor was himself
128	begotten of Zeus by the daughter of the founder of the deme And these
129	are the sort of old wives tales which he sings and recites to us and
130	we are obliged to listen to him 
132	 When I heard this I said O ridiculous Hippothales how can you
133	be making and singing hymns in honour of yourself before you have won 
135	 But my songs and verses he said are not in honour of myself 
136	Socrates 
138	 You think not I said 
140	 Nay but what do you think he replied 
142	 Most assuredly I said those songs are all in your own honour 
143	for if you win your beautiful love your discourses and songs will
144	be a glory to you and may be truly regarded as hymns of praise
145	composed in honour of you who have conquered and won such a love 
146	but if he slips away from you the more you have praised him the more
147	ridiculous you will look at having lost this fairest and best of
148	blessings and therefore the wise lover does not praise his beloved
149	until he has won him because he is afraid of accidents There is also
150	another danger the fair when any one praises or magnifies them 
151	are filled with the spirit of pride and vain glory Do you not agree
152	with me 
154	 Yes he said 
156	 And the more vain glorious they are the more difficult is the
157	capture of them 
159	 I believe you 
161	 What should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey and
162	made the capture of the animals which he is hunting more difficult 
164	 He would be a bad hunter undoubtedly 
166	 Yes and if instead of soothing them he were to infuriate them
167	with words and songs that would show a great want of wit do you
168	not agree 
170	 Yes 
172	 And now reflect Hippothales and see whether you are not guilty
173	of all these errors in writing poetry For I can hardly suppose that
174	you will affirm a man to be a good poet who injures himself by his
175	poetry 
177	 Assuredly not he said such a poet would be a fool And this is the
178	reason why I take you into my counsels Socrates and I shall be
179	glad of any further advice which you may have to offer Will you
180	tell me by what words or actions I may become endeared to my love 
182	 That is not easy to determine I said but if you will bring your
183	love to me and will let me talk with him I may perhaps be able to
184	show you how to converse with him instead of singing and reciting
185	in the fashion of which you are accused 
187	 There will be no difficulty in bringing him he replied if you will
188	only go with Ctesippus into the Palaestra and sit down and talk I
189	believe that he will come of his own accord for he is fond of
190	listening Socrates And as this is the festival of the Hermaea the
191	young men and boys are all together and there is no separation
192	between them He will be sure to come but if he does not Ctesippus
193	with whom he is familiar and whose relation Menexenus is his great
194	friend shall call him 
196	 That will be the way I said Thereupon I led Ctesippus into the
197	Palaestra and the rest followed 
199	 Upon entering we found that the boys had just been sacrificing 
200	and this part of the festival was nearly at an end They were all in
201	their white array and games at dice were going on among them Most of
202	them were in the outer court amusing themselves but some were in a
203	corner of the Apodyterium playing at odd and even with a number of
204	dice which they took out of little wicker baskets There was also a
205	circle of lookers on among them was Lysis He was standing with the
206	other boys and youths having a crown upon his head like a fair
207	vision and not less worthy of praise for his goodness than for his
208	beauty We left them and went over to the opposite side of the
209	room where finding a quiet place we sat down and then we began
210	to talk This attracted Lysis who was constantly turning round to
211	look at us he was evidently wanting to come to us For a time he
212	hesitated and had not the courage to come alone but first of all his
213	friend Menexenus leaving his play entered the Palaestra from the
214	court and when he saw Ctesippus and myself was going to take a
215	seat by us and then Lysis seeing him followed and sat down by
216	his side and the other boys joined I should observe that
217	Hippothales when he saw the crowd got behind them where he
218	thought that he would be out of sight of Lysis lest he should anger
219	him and there he stood and listened 
221	 I turned to Menexenus and said Son of Demophon which of you two
222	youths is the elder 
224	 That is a matter of dispute between us he said 
226	 And which is the nobler Is that also a matter of dispute 
228	 Yes certainly 
230	 And another disputed point is which is the fairer 
232	 The two boys laughed 
234	 I shall not ask which is the richer of the two I said for you
235	are friends are you not 
237	 Certainly they replied 
239	 And friends have all things in common so that one of you can be
240	no richer than the other if you say truly that you are friends 
242	 They assented I was about to ask which was the juster of the two 
243	and which was the wiser of the two but at this moment Menexenus was
244	called away by some one who came and said that the gymnastic master
245	wanted him I supposed that he had to offer sacrifice So he went
246	away and I asked Lysis some more questions I dare say Lysis I
247	said that your father and mother love you very much 
249	 Certainly he said 
251	 And they would wish you to be perfectly happy 
253	 Yes 
255	 But do you think that any one is happy who is in the condition of
256	a slave and who cannot do what he likes 
258	 I should think not indeed he said 
260	 And if your father and mother love you and desire that you should
261	be happy no one can doubt that they are very ready to promote your
262	happiness 
264	 Certainly he replied 
266	 And do they then permit you to do what you like and never rebuke
267	you or hinder you from doing what you desire 
269	 Yes indeed Socrates there are a great many things which they
270	hinder me from doing 
272	 What do you mean I said Do they want you to be happy and yet
273	hinder you from doing what you like For example if you want to mount
274	one of your father s chariots and take the reins at a race they will
275	not allow you to do so they will prevent you 
277	 Certainly he said they will not allow me to do so 
279	 Whom then will they allow 
281	 There is a charioteer whom my father pays for driving 
283	 And do they trust a hireling more than you and may he do what he
284	likes with the horses and do they pay him for this 
286	 They do 
288	 But I dare say that you may take the whip and guide the mule cart if
289	you like they will permit that 
291	 Permit me indeed they will not 
293	 Then I said may no one use the whip to the mules 
295	 Yes he said the muleteer 
297	 And is he a slave or a free man 
299	 A slave he said 
301	 And do they esteem a slave of more value than you who are their son 
302	And do they entrust their property to him rather than to you and
303	allow him to do what he likes when they prohibit you Answer me
304	now Are you your own master or do they not even allow that 
306	 Nay he said of course they do not allow it 
308	 Then you have a master 
310	 Yes my tutor there he is 
312	 And is he a slave 
314	 To be sure he is our slave he replied 
316	 Surely I said this is a strange thing that a free man should be
317	governed by a slave And what does he do with you 
319	 He takes me to my teachers 
321	 You do not mean to say that your teachers also rule over you 
323	 Of course they do 
325	 Then I must say that your father is pleased to inflict many lords
326	and masters on you But at any rate when you go home to your mother 
327	she will let you have your own way and will not interfere with your
328	happiness her wool or the piece of cloth which she is weaving are
329	at your disposal I am sure that there is nothing to hinder you from
330	touching her wooden spathe or her comb or any other of her
331	spinning implements 
333	 Nay Socrates he replied laughing not only does she hinder me 
334	but I should be beaten if I were to touch one of them 
336	 Well I said this is amazing And did you ever behave ill to your
337	father or your mother 
339	 No indeed he replied 
341	 But why then are they so terribly anxious to prevent you from
342	being happy and doing as you like keeping you all day long in
343	subjection to another and in a word doing nothing which you desire 
344	so that you have no good as would appear out of their great
345	possessions which are under the control of anybody rather than of
346	you and have no use of your own fair person which is tended and
347	taken care of by another while you Lysis are master of nobody 
348	and can do nothing 
350	 Why he said Socrates the reason is that I am not of age 
352	 I doubt whether that is the real reason I said for I should
353	imagine that your father Democrates and your mother do permit you to
354	do many things already and do not wait until you are of age for
355	example if they want anything read or written you I presume 
356	would be the first person in the house who is summoned by them 
358	 Very true 
360	 And you would be allowed to write or read the letters in any order
361	which you please or to take up the lyre and tune the notes and
362	play with the fingers or strike with the plectrum exactly as you
363	please and neither father nor mother would interfere with you 
365	 That is true he said 
367	 Then what can be the reason Lysis I said why they allow you to do
368	the one and not the other 
370	 I suppose he said because I understand the one and not the other 
372	 Yes my dear youth I said the reason is not any deficiency of
373	years but a deficiency of knowledge and whenever your father
374	thinks that you are wiser than he is he will instantly commit himself
375	and his possessions to you 
377	 I think so 
379	 Aye I said and about your neighbour too does not the same rule
380	hold as about your father If he is satisfied that you know more of
381	housekeeping than he does will he continue to administer his
382	affairs himself or will he commit them to you 
384	 I think that he will commit them to me 
386	 Will not the Athenian people too entrust their affairs to you when
387	they see that you have wisdom enough to manage them 
389	 Yes 
391	 And oh let me put another case I said There is the great king 
392	and he has an eldest son who is the Prince of Asia suppose that
393	you and I go to him and establish to his satisfaction that we are
394	better cooks than his son will he not entrust to us the prerogative
395	of making soup and putting in anything that we like while the pot
396	is boiling rather than to the Prince of Asia who is his son 
398	 To us clearly 
400	 And we shall be allowed to throw in salt by handfuls whereas the
401	son will not be allowed to put in as much as he can take up between
402	his fingers 
404	 Of course 
406	 Or suppose again that the son has bad eyes will he allow him or
407	will he not allow him to touch his own eyes if he thinks that he
408	has no knowledge of medicine 
410	 He will not allow him 
412	 Whereas if he supposes us to have a knowledge of medicine he
413	will allow us to do what we like with him even to open the eyes wide
414	and sprinkle ashes upon them because he supposes that we know what is
415	best 
417	 That is true 
419	 And everything in which we appear to him to be wiser than himself or
420	his son he will commit to us 
422	 That is very true Socrates he replied 
424	 Then now my dear Lysis I said you perceive that in things which
425	we know every one will trust us Hellenes and barbarians men and
426	women and we may do as we please about them and no one will like to
427	interfere with us we shall be free and masters of others and
428	these things will be really ours for we shall be benefited by them 
429	But in things of which we have no understanding no one will trust
430	us to do as seems good to us they will hinder us as far as they can 
431	and not only strangers but father and mother and the friend if
432	there be one who is dearer still will also hinder us and we shall
433	be subject to others and these things will not be ours for we
434	shall not be benefited by them Do you agree 
436	 He assented 
438	 And shall we be friends to others and will any others love us in
439	as far as we are useless to them 
441	 Certainly not 
443	 Neither can your father or mother love you nor can anybody love
444	anybody else in so far as they are useless to them 
446	 No 
448	 And therefore my boy if you are wise all men will be your
449	friends and kindred for you will be useful and good but if you are
450	not wise neither father nor mother nor kindred nor any one else 
451	will be your friends And in matters of which you have as yet no
452	knowledge can you have any conceit of knowledge 
454	 That is impossible he replied 
456	 And you Lysis if you require a teacher have not yet attained to
457	wisdom 
459	 True 
461	 And therefore you are not conceited having nothing of which to be
462	conceited 
464	 Indeed Socrates I think not 
466	 When I heard him say this I turned to Hippothales and was very
467	nearly making a blunder for I was going to say to him That is the
468	way Hippothales in which you should talk to your beloved humbling
469	and lowering him and not as you do puffing him up and spoiling
470	him But I saw that he was in great excitement and confusion at what
471	had been said and I remembered that although he was in the
472	neighbourhood he did not want to be seen by Lysis so upon second
473	thoughts I refrained 
475	 In the meantime Menexenus came back and sat down in his place by
476	Lysis and Lysis in a childish and affectionate manner whispered
477	privately in my ear so that Menexenus should not hear Do 
478	Socrates tell Menexenus what you have been telling me 
480	 Suppose that you tell him yourself Lysis I replied for I am
481	sure that you were attending 
483	 Certainly he replied 
485	 Try then to remember the words and be as exact as you can in
486	repeating them to him and if you have forgotten anything ask me
487	again the next time that you see me 
489	 I will be sure to do so Socrates but go on telling him something
490	new and let me hear as long as I am allowed to stay 
492	 I certainly cannot refuse I said since you ask me but then as
493	you know Menexenus is very pugnacious and therefore you must come to
494	the rescue if he attempts to upset me 
496	 Yes indeed he said he is very pugnacious and that is the
497	reason why I want you to argue with him 
499	 That I may make a fool of myself 
501	 No indeed he said but I want you to put him down 
503	 That is no easy matter I replied for he is a terrible fellow a
504	pupil of Ctesippus And there is Ctesippus himself do you see him 
506	 Never mind Socrates you shall argue with him 
508	 Well I suppose that I must I replied 
510	 Hereupon Ctesippus complained that we were talking in secret and
511	keeping the feast to ourselves 
513	 I shall be happy I said to let you have a share Here is Lysis 
514	who does not understand something that I was saying and wants me to
515	ask Menexenus who as he thinks is likely to know 
517	 And why do you not ask him he said 
519	 Very well I said I will and do you Menexenus answer But
520	first I must tell you that I am one who from my childhood upward
521	have set my heart upon a certain thing All people have their fancies 
522	some desire horses and others dogs and some are fond of gold and
523	others of honour Now I have no violent desire of any of these
524	things but I have a passion for friends and I would rather have a
525	good friend than the best cock or quail in the world I would even
526	go further and say the best horse or dog Yea by the dog of Egypt I
527	should greatly prefer a real friend to all the gold of Darius or even
528	to Darius himself I am such a lover of friends as that And when I
529	see you and Lysis at your early age so easily possessed of this
530	treasure and so soon he of you and you of him I am amazed and
531	delighted seeing that I myself although I am now advanced in
532	years am so far from having made a similar acquisition that I do not
533	even know in what way a friend is acquired But want to ask you a
534	question about this for you have experience tell me then when one
535	loves another is the lover or the beloved the friend or may either
536	be the friend 
538	 Either may I should think be the friend of either 
540	 Do you mean I said that if only one of them loves the other 
541	they are mutual friends 
543	 Yes he said that is my meaning 
545	 But what if the lover is not loved in return which is a very
546	possible case 
548	 Yes 
550	 Or is perhaps even hated which is a fancy which sometimes is
551	entertained by lovers respecting their beloved Nothing can exceed
552	their love and yet they imagine either that they are not loved in
553	return or that they are hated Is not that true 
555	 Yes he said quite true 
557	 In that case the one loves and the other is loved 
559	 Yes 
561	 Then which is the friend of which Is the lover the friend of the
562	beloved whether he be loved in return or hated or is the beloved
563	the friend or is there no friendship at all on either side unless
564	they both love one another 
566	 There would seem to be none at all 
568	 Then this notion is not in accordance with our previous one We were
569	saying that both were friends if one only loved but now unless they
570	both love neither is a friend 
572	 That appears to be true 
574	 Then nothing which does not love in return is beloved by a lover 
576	 I think not 
578	 Then they are not lovers of horses whom the horses do not love in
579	return nor lovers of quails nor of dogs nor of wine nor of
580	gymnastic exercises who have no return of love no nor of wisdom 
581	unless wisdom loves them in return Or shall we say that they do
582	love them although they are not beloved by them and that the poet
583	was wrong who sings 
585	 Happy the man to whom his children are dear and steeds having
586	single hoofs and dogs of chase and the stranger of another land 
588	 I do not think that he was wrong 
590	 You think that he is right 
592	 Yes 
594	 Then Menexenus the conclusion is that what is beloved whether
595	loving or hating may be dear to the lover of it for example very
596	young children too young to love or even hating their father or
597	mother when they are punished by them are never dearer to them than
598	at the time when they are being hated by them 
600	 I think that what you say is true 
602	 And if so not the lover but the beloved is the friend or dear
603	one 
605	 Yes 
607	 And the hated one and not the hater is the enemy 
609	 Clearly 
611	 Then many men are loved by their enemies and hated by their
612	friends and are the friends of their enemies and the enemies of
613	their friends Yet how absurd my dear friend or indeed impossible is
614	this paradox of a man being an enemy to his friend or a friend to
615	his enemy 
617	 I quite agree Socrates in what you say 
619	 But if this cannot be the lover will be the friend of that which is
620	loved 
622	 True 
624	 And the hater will be the enemy of that which is hated 
626	 Certainly 
628	 Yet we must acknowledge in this as in the preceding instance 
629	that a man may be the friend of one who is not his friend or who
630	may be his enemy when he loves that which does not love him or
631	which even hates him And he may be the enemy of one who is not his
632	enemy and is even his friend for example when he hates that which
633	does not hate him or which even loves him 
635	 That appears to be true 
637	 But if the lover is not a friend nor the beloved a friend nor both
638	together what are we to say Whom are we to call friends to one
639	another Do any remain 
641	 Indeed Socrates I cannot find any 
643	 But O Menexenus I said may we not have been altogether wrong in
644	our conclusions 
646	 I am sure that we have been wrong Socrates said Lysis And he
647	blushed as he spoke the words seeming to come from his lips
648	involuntarily because his whole mind was taken up with the
649	argument there was no mistaking his attentive look while he was
650	listening 
652	 I was pleased at the interest which was shown by Lysis and I wanted
653	to give Menexenus a rest so I turned to him and said I think Lysis 
654	that what you say is true and that if we had been right we should
655	never have gone so far wrong let us proceed no further in this
656	direction for the road seems to be getting troublesome but take the
657	other path into which we turned and see what the poets have to say 
658	for they are to us in a manner the fathers and authors of wisdom 
659	and they speak of friends in no light or trivial manner but God
660	himself as they say makes them and draws them to one another and
661	this they express if I am not mistaken in the following words 
663	 God is ever drawing like towards like and
665	 making them acquainted 
667	I dare say that you have heard those words 
669	 Yes he said I have 
671	 And have you not also met with the treatises of philosophers who say
672	that like must love like they are the people who argue and write
673	about nature and the universe 
675	 Very true he replied 
677	 And are they right in saying this 
679	 They may be 
681	 Perhaps I said about half or possibly altogether right if
682	their meaning were rightly apprehended by us For the more a bad man
683	has to do with a bad man and the more nearly he is brought into
684	contact with him the more he will be likely to hate him for he
685	injures him and injurer and injured cannot be friends Is not that
686	true 
688	 Yes he said 
690	 Then one half of the saying is untrue if the wicked are like one
691	another 
693	 That is true 
695	 But the real meaning of the saying as I imagine is that the good
696	are like one another friends to one another and that the bad as
697	is often said of them are never at unity with one another or with
698	themselves for they are passionate and restless and anything which
699	is at variance and enmity with itself is not likely to be in union
700	or harmony with any other thing Do you not agree 
702	 Yes I do 
704	 Then my friend those who say that the like is friendly to the like
705	mean to intimate if I rightly apprehend them that the good only is
706	the friend of the good and of him only but that the evil never
707	attains to any real friendship either with good or evil Do you
708	agree 
710	 He nodded assent 
712	 Then now we know how to answer the question Who are friends for
713	the argument declares That the good are friends 
715	 Yes he said that is true 
717	 Yes I replied and yet I am not quite satisfied with this answer 
718	By heaven and shall I tell you what I suspect I will Assuming
719	that like inasmuch as he is like is the friend of like and useful
720	to him or rather let me try another way of putting the matter Can
721	like do any good or harm to like which he could not do to himself 
722	or suffer anything from his like which he would not suffer from
723	himself And if neither can be of any use to the other how can they
724	be loved by one another Can they now 
726	 They cannot 
728	 And can he who is not loved be a friend 
730	 Certainly not 
732	 But say that the like is not the friend of the like in so far as
733	he is like still the good may be the friend of the good in so far
734	as he is good 
736	 True 
738	 But then again will not the good in so far as he is good be
739	sufficient for himself Certainly he will And he who is sufficient
740	wants nothing that is implied in the word sufficient 
742	 Of course not 
744	 And he who wants nothing will desire nothing 
746	 He will not 
748	 Neither can he love that which he does not desire 
750	 He cannot 
752	 And he who not is not a lover of friend 
754	 Clearly not 
756	 What place then is there for friendship if when absent good men
757	have no need of one another for even when alone they are sufficient
758	for themselves and when present have no use of one another How
759	can such persons ever be induced to value one another 
761	 They cannot 
763	 And friends they cannot be unless they value one another 
765	 Very true 
767	 But see now Lysis whether we are not being deceived in all
768	this are we not indeed entirely wrong 
770	 How so he replied 
772	 Have I not heard some one say as I just now recollect that the
773	like is the greatest enemy of the like the good of the good Yes and
774	he quoted the authority of Hesiod who says 
776	 Potter quarrels with potter hard with bard 
778	 Beggar with beggar 
780	and of all other things he affirmed in like manner That of
781	necessity the most like are most full of envy strife and hatred of
782	one another and the most unlike of friendship For the poor man is
783	compelled to be the friend of the rich and the weak requires the
784	aid of the strong and the sick man of the physician and every one
785	who is ignorant has to love and court him who knows And indeed he
786	went on to say in grandiloquent language that the idea of
787	friendship existing between similars is not the truth but the very
788	reverse of the truth and that the most opposed are the most friendly 
789	for that everything desires not like but that which is most unlike 
790	for example the dry desires the moist the cold the hot the bitter
791	the sweet the sharp the blunt the void the full the full the
792	void and so of all other things for the opposite is the food of
793	the opposite whereas like receives nothing from like And I thought
794	that he who said this was a charming man and that he spoke well What
795	do the rest of you say 
797	 I should say at first hearing that he is right said Menexenus 
799	 Then we are to say that the greatest friendship is of opposites 
801	 Exactly 
803	 Yes Menexenus but will not that be a monstrous answer and will
804	not the all wise eristics be down upon us in triumph and ask 
805	fairly enough whether love is not the very opposite of hate and what
806	answer shall we make to them must we not admit that they speak the
807	truth 
809	 We must 
811	 They will then proceed to ask whether the enemy is the friend of the
812	friend or the friend the friend of the enemy 
814	 Neither he replied 
816	 Well but is a just man the friend of the unjust or the temperate
817	of the intemperate or the good of the bad 
819	 I do not see how that is possible 
821	 And yet I said if friendship goes by contraries the contraries
822	must be friends 
824	 They must 
826	 Then neither like and like nor unlike and unlike are friends 
828	 I suppose not 
830	 And yet there is a further consideration may not all these
831	notions of friendship be erroneous but may not that which is
832	neither good nor evil still in some cases be the friend of the good 
834	 How do you mean he said 
836	 Why really I said the truth is that I do not know but my head
837	is dizzy with thinking of the argument and therefore I hazard the
838	conjecture that the beautiful is the friend as the old proverb
839	says Beauty is certainly a soft smooth slippery thing and
840	therefore of a nature which easily slips in and permeates our souls 
841	For I affirm that the good is the beautiful You will agree to that 
843	 Yes 
845	 This I say from a sort of notion that what is neither good nor
846	evil is the friend of the beautiful and the good and I will tell
847	you why I am inclined to think so I assume that there are three
848	principles the good the bad and that which is neither good nor
849	bad You would agree would you not 
851	 I agree 
853	 And neither is the good the friend of the good nor the evil of
854	the good nor the good of the evil these alternatives are excluded by
855	the previous argument and therefore if there be such a thing as
856	friendship or love at all we must infer that what is neither good nor
857	evil must be the friend either of the good or of that which is
858	neither good nor evil for nothing can be the friend of the bad 
860	 True 
862	 But neither can like be the friend of like as we were just now
863	saying 
865	 True 
867	 And if so that which is neither good nor evil can have no friend
868	which is neither good nor evil 
870	 Clearly not 
872	 Then the good alone is the friend of that only which is neither good
873	nor evil 
875	 That may be assumed to be certain 
877	 And does not this seem to put us in the right way Just remark that
878	the body which is in health requires neither medical nor any other
879	aid but is well enough and the healthy man has no love of the
880	physician because he is in health 
882	 He has none 
884	 But the sick loves him because he is sick 
886	 Certainly 
888	 And sickness is an evil and the art of medicine a good and useful
889	thing 
891	 Yes 
893	 But the human body regarded as a body is neither good nor evil 
895	 True 
897	 And the body is compelled by reason of disease to court and make
898	friends of the art of medicine 
900	 Yes 
902	 Then that which is neither good nor evil becomes the friend of good 
903	by reason of the presence of evil 
905	 So we may infer 
907	 And clearly this must have happened before that which was neither
908	good nor evil had become altogether corrupted with the element of
909	evil if itself had become evil it would not still desire and love
910	the good for as we were saying the evil cannot be the friend of the
911	good 
913	 Impossible 
915	 Further I must observe that some substances are assimilated when
916	others are present with them and there are some which are not
917	assimilated take for example the case of an ointment or colour
918	which is put on another substance 
920	 Very good 
922	 In such a case is the substance which is anointed the same as the
923	colour or ointment 
925	 What do you mean he said 
927	 This is what I mean Suppose that I were to cover your auburn
928	locks with white lead would they be really white or would they
929	only appear to be white 
931	 They would only appear to be white he replied 
933	 And yet whiteness would be present in them 
935	 True 
937	 But that would not make them at all the more white 
938	notwithstanding the presence of white in them they would not be
939	white any more than black 
941	 No 
943	 But when old age infuses whiteness into them then they become
944	assimilated and are white by the presence of white 
946	 Certainly 
948	 Now I want to know whether in all cases a substance is assimilated
949	by the presence of another substance or must the presence be after
950	a peculiar sort 
952	 The latter he said 
954	 Then that which is neither good nor evil may be in the presence of
955	evil but not as yet evil and that has happened before now 
957	 Yes 
959	 And when anything is in the presence of evil not being as yet evil 
960	the presence of good arouses the desire of good in that thing but the
961	presence of evil which makes a thing evil takes away the desire
962	and friendship of the good for that which was once both good and evil
963	has now become evil only and the good was supposed to have no
964	friendship with the evil 
966	 None 
968	 And therefore we say that those who are already wise whether Gods
969	or men are no longer lovers of wisdom nor can they be lovers of
970	wisdom who are ignorant to the extent of being evil for no evil or
971	ignorant person is a lover of wisdom There remain those who have
972	the misfortune to be ignorant but are not yet hardened in their
973	ignorance or void of understanding and do not as yet fancy that they
974	know what they do not know and therefore those who are the lovers
975	of wisdom are as yet neither good nor bad But the bad do not love
976	wisdom any more than the good for as we have already seen neither
977	is unlike the friend of unlike nor like of like You remember that 
979	 Yes they both said 
981	 And so Lysis and Menexenus we have discovered the nature of
982	friendship there can be no doubt of it Friendship is the love which
983	by reason of the presence of evil the neither good nor evil has of the
984	good either in the soul or in the body or anywhere 
986	 They both agreed and entirely assented and for a moment I
987	rejoiced and was satisfied like a huntsman just holding fast his prey 
988	But then a most unaccountable suspicion came across me and I felt
989	that the conclusion was untrue I was pained and said Alas Lysis
990	and Menexenus I am afraid that we have been grasping at a shadow
991	only 
993	 Why do you say so said Menexenus 
995	 I am afraid I said that the argument about friendship is false 
996	arguments like men are often pretenders 
998	 How do you mean he asked 
1000	 Well I said look at the matter in this way a friend is the friend
1001	of some one is he not 
1003	 Certainly he is 
1005	 And has he a motive and object in being a friend or has he no
1006	motive and object 
1008	 He has a motive and object 
1010	 And is the object which makes him a friend dear to him neither
1011	dear nor hateful to him 
1013	 I do not quite follow you he said 
1015	 I do not wonder at that I said But perhaps if I put the matter in
1016	another way you will be able to follow me and my own meaning will be
1017	clearer to myself The sick man as I was just now saying is the
1018	friend of the physician is he not 
1020	 Yes 
1022	 And he is the friend of the physician because of disease and for
1023	the sake of health 
1025	 Yes 
1027	 And disease is an evil 
1029	 Certainly 
1031	 And what of health I said Is that good or evil or neither 
1033	 Good he replied 
1035	 And we were saying I believe that the body being neither good
1036	nor evil because of disease that is to say because of evil is the
1037	friend of medicine and medicine is a good and medicine has entered
1038	into this friendship for the sake of health and health is a good 
1040	 True 
1042	 And is health a friend or not a friend 
1044	 A friend 
1046	 And disease is an enemy 
1048	 Yes 
1050	 Then that which is neither good nor evil is the friend of the good
1051	because of the evil and hateful and for the sake of the good and
1052	the friend 
1054	 Clearly 
1056	 Then the friend is a friend for the sake of the friend and
1057	because of the enemy 
1059	 That is to be inferred 
1061	 Then at this point my boys let us take heed and be on our guard
1062	against deceptions I will not again repeat that the friend is the
1063	friend of the friend and the like of the like which has been
1064	declared by us to be an impossibility but in order that this new
1065	statement may not delude us let us attentively examine another point 
1066	which I will proceed to explain Medicine as we were saying is a
1067	friend dear to us for the sake of health 
1069	 Yes 
1071	 And health is also dear 
1073	 Certainly 
1075	 And if dear then dear for the sake of something 
1077	 Yes 
1079	 And surely this object must also be dear as is implied in our
1080	previous admissions 
1082	 Yes 
1084	 And that something dear involves something else dear 
1086	 Yes 
1088	 But then proceeding in this way shall we not arrive at some
1089	first principle of friendship or dearness which is not capable of
1090	being referred to any other for the sake of which as we maintain 
1091	all other things are dear and having there arrived we shall stop 
1093	 True 
1095	 My fear is that all those other things which as we say are dear
1096	for the sake of another are illusions and deceptions only but
1097	where that first principle is there is the true ideal of
1098	friendship Let me put the matter thus Suppose the case of a great
1099	treasure this may be a son who is more precious to his father than
1100	all his other treasures would not the father who values his son
1101	above all things value other things also for the sake of his son I
1102	mean for instance if he knew that his son had drunk hemlock and the
1103	father thought that wine would save him he would value the wine 
1105	 He would 
1107	 And also the vessel which contains the wine 
1109	 Certainly 
1111	 But does he therefore value the three measures of wine or the
1112	earthen vessel which contains them equally with his son Is not
1113	this rather the true state of the case All his anxiety has regard not
1114	to the means which are provided for the sake of an object but to
1115	the object for the sake of which they are provided And although we
1116	may often say that gold and silver are highly valued by us that is
1117	not the truth for there is a further object whatever it may be 
1118	which we value most of all and for the sake of which gold and all out
1119	other possessions are acquired by us Am I not right 
1121	 Yes certainly 
1123	 And may not the same be said of the friend That which is only
1124	dear to us for the sake of something else is improperly said to be
1125	dear but the truly dear is that in which all these so called dear
1126	friendships terminate 
1128	 That he said appears to be true 
1130	 And the truly dear or ultimate principle of friendship is not for
1131	the sake of any other or further dear 
1133	 True 
1135	 Then we have done with the notion that friendship has any further
1136	object May we then infer that the good is the friend 
1138	 I think so 
1140	 And the good is loved for the sake of the evil Let me put the
1141	case in this way Suppose that of the three principles good evil 
1142	and that which is neither good nor evil there remained only the
1143	good and the neutral and that evil went far away and in no way
1144	affected soul or body nor ever at all that class of things which 
1145	as we say are neither good nor evil in themselves would the good
1146	be of any use or other than useless to us For if there were
1147	nothing to hurt us any longer we should have no need of anything that
1148	would do us good Then would be clearly seen that we did but love
1149	and desire the good because of the evil and as the remedy of the
1150	evil which was the disease but if there had been no disease there
1151	would have been no need of a remedy Is not this the nature of the
1152	good to be loved by us who are placed between the two because of
1153	the evil but there is no use in the good for its own sake 
1155	 I suppose not 
1157	 Then the final principle of friendship in which all other
1158	friendships terminated those I mean which are relatively dear and
1159	for the sake of something else is of another and a different nature
1160	from them For they are called dear because of another dear or friend 
1161	But with the true friend or dear the case is quite the reverse for
1162	that is proved to be dear because of the hated and if the hated
1163	were away it would be no longer dear 
1165	 Very true he replied at any rate not if our present view holds
1166	good 
1168	 But oh will you tell me I said whether if evil were to perish 
1169	we should hunger any more or thirst any more or have any similar
1170	desire Or may we suppose that hunger will remain while men and
1171	animals remain but not so as to be hurtful And the same of thirst
1172	and the other desires that they will remain but will not be evil
1173	because evil has perished Or rather shall I say that to ask what
1174	either will be then or will not be is ridiculous for who knows 
1175	This we do know that in our present condition hunger may injure us 
1176	and may also benefit us Is not that true 
1178	 Yes 
1180	 And in like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a
1181	good and sometimes an evil to us and sometimes neither one nor the
1182	other 
1184	 To be sure 
1186	 But is there any reason why because evil perishes that which is
1187	not evil should perish with it 
1189	 None 
1191	 Then even if evil perishes the desires which are neither good
1192	nor evil will remain 
1194	 Clearly they will 
1196	 And must not a man love that which he desires and affects 
1198	 He must 
1200	 Then even if evil perishes there may still remain some elements of
1201	love or friendship 
1203	 Yes 
1205	 But not if evil is the cause of friendship for in that case nothing
1206	will be the friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil 
1207	for the effect cannot remain when the cause is destroyed 
1209	 True 
1211	 And have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for
1212	a reason and at the time of making the admission we were of opinion
1213	that the neither good nor evil loves the good because of the evil 
1215	 Very true 
1217	 But now our view is changed and we conceive that there must be some
1218	other cause of friendship 
1220	 I suppose so 
1222	 May not the truth be rather as we were saying just now that desire
1223	is the cause of friendship for that which desires is dear to that
1224	which is desired at the time of desiring it and may not the other
1225	theory have been only a long story about nothing 
1227	 Likely enough 
1229	 But surely I said he who desires desires that of which he is in
1230	want 
1232	 Yes 
1234	 And that of which he is in want is dear to him 
1236	 True 
1238	 And he is in want of that of which he is deprived 
1240	 Certainly 
1242	 Then love and desire and friendship would appear to be of the
1243	natural or congenial Such Lysis and Menexenus is the inference 
1245	 They assented 
1247	 Then if you are friends you must have natures which are congenial
1248	to one another 
1250	 Certainly they both said 
1252	 And I say my boys that no one who loves or desires another would
1253	ever have loved or desired or affected him if he had not been in some
1254	way congenial to him either in his soul or in his character or in
1255	his manners or in his form 
1257	 Yes yes said Menexenus But Lysis was silent 
1259	 Then I said the conclusion is that what is of a congenial
1260	nature must be loved 
1262	 It follows he said 
1264	 Then the lover who is true and no counterfeit must of necessity be
1265	loved by his love 
1267	 Lysis and Menexenus gave a faint assent to this and Hippothales
1268	changed into all manner of colours with delight 
1270	 Here intending to revise the argument I said Can we point out any
1271	difference between the congenial and the like For if that is
1272	possible then I think Lysis and Menexenus there may be some sense
1273	in our argument about friendship But if the congenial is only the
1274	like how will you get rid of the other argument of the uselessness
1275	of like to like in as far as they are like for to say that what is
1276	useless is dear would be absurd Suppose then that we agree to
1277	distinguish between the congenial and the like in the intoxication
1278	of argument that may perhaps be allowed 
1280	 Very true 
1282	 And shall we further say that the good is congenial and the evil
1283	uncongenial to every one Or again that the evil is congenial to the
1284	evil and the good to the good and that which is neither good nor
1285	evil to that which is neither good nor evil 
1287	 They agreed to the latter alternative 
1289	 Then my boys we have again fallen into the old discarded error 
1290	for the unjust will be the friend of the unjust and the bad of the
1291	bad as well as the good of the good 
1293	 That appears to be the result 
1295	 But again if we say that the congenial is the same as the good 
1296	in that case the good and he only will be the friend of the good 
1298	 True 
1300	 But that too was a position of ours which as you will remember has
1301	been already refuted by ourselves 
1303	 We remember 
1305	 Then what is to be done Or rather is there anything to be done I
1306	can only like the wise men who argue in courts sum up the
1307	arguments If neither the beloved nor the lover nor the like nor
1308	the unlike nor the good nor the congenial nor any other of whom
1309	we spoke for there were such a number of them that I cannot remember
1310	all if none of these are friends I know not what remains to be said 
1312	 Here I was going to invite the opinion of some older person when
1313	suddenly we were interrupted by the tutors of Lysis and Menexenus who
1314	came upon us like an evil apparition with their brothers and bade
1315	them go home as it was getting late At first we and the
1316	bystanders drove them off but afterwards as they would not mind and
1317	only went on shouting in their barbarous dialect and got angry and
1318	kept calling the boys they appeared to us to have been drinking rather
1319	too much at the Hermaea which made them difficult to manage we fairly
1320	gave way and broke up the company 
1322	 I said however a few words to the boys at parting O Menexenus and
1323	Lysis how ridiculous that you two boys and I an old boy who
1324	would fain be one of you should imagine ourselves to be
1325	friends this is what the by standers will go away and say and as yet
1326	we have not been able to discover what is a friend 
1328	 THE END
