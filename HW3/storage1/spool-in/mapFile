exactly	1
the	1

I	1
made	1
another	1

Then	1
I	1

myself	1
you	1
be	1
detected	1
now	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
you	1
more	1

they	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
some	1

conscious	1
I	1
they	1

in	1
other	1
things	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
and	1
I	1
sure	1
they	1
knew	1
many	1

I	1
they	1

But	1
I	1
observed	1
the	1
good	1

into	1
the	1

this	1
in	1
them	1
their	1

the	1
I	1
were	1
neither	1
their	1

their	1
like	1
them	1
in	1

and	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
I	1
better	1
off	1
as	1
I	1
inquisition	1

many	1
enemies	1
And	1
I	1
swear	1

And	1
I	1
am	1
called	1

I	1
myself	1
the	1

I	1
find	1
wanting	1

And	1
only	1

And	1
you	1
may	1

	1
I	1

in	1

	1
I	1
replied	1
what	1
is	1
who	1
does	1
good	1
is	1
temperate	1
a	1
physician	1
who	1
cures	1
a	1

is	1

who	1

I	1

who	1

temperance	1
know	1
is	1
be	1

be	1
the	1
work	1

is	1
doing	1
	1
I	1

	1
Then	1
I	1

may	1
do	1

harm	1

what	1

you	1

so	1
does	1
his	1

done	1
	1
	1
Then	1
as	1
in	1

be	1

know	1
his	1

the	1
necessarily	1
	1
But	1
Socrates	1
said	1
is	1
impossible	1

if	1
this	1

as	1
you	1
imply	1
the	1
necessary	1
consequence	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
I	1
withdraw	1
them	1
than	1
himself	1
should	1
just	1
now	1
what	1
I	1

be	1

who	1
does	1

in	1
this	1
I	1

the	1

a	1

addresses	1
who	1
the	1

Never	1

all	1
this	1
is	1
the	1

	1
in	1

Shall	1
I	1
you	1

a	1

Critias	1
you	1
I	1

I	1
with	1

I	1

the	1

	1
True	1
	1
And	1
suppose	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
were	1
asked	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
of	1
medicine	1
which	1
is	1
this	1

I	1
should	1
medicine	1
have	1
the	1
as	1

anything	1

of	1
very	1
great	1
I	1
say	1
you	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
	1
	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
producing	1
health	1
which	1
as	1
architecture	1
which	1

the	1

I	1

houses	1

so	1
of	1
other	1
which	1
all	1
have	1
their	1

Now	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
Critias	1
a	1
similar	1
temperance	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
advanced	1
just	1
wisdom	1
which	1
according	1
say	1
the	1
ordinary	1
of	1
is	1
right	1
this	1
view	1
I	1
of	1
you	1
what	1
good	1
work	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
does	1
temperance	1
wisdom	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
itself	1
Answer	1
me	1
	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Socrates	1
said	1
wisdom	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
like	1
one	1
another	1
you	1
as	1
as	1
speak	1
a	1
worshipper	1
enters	1
the	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
alike	1
For	1
me	1
sense	1
as	1
a	1
is	1
the	1
any	1
other	1
work	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
Can	1
you	1
show	1
me	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
You	1
	1
That	1
is	1
I	1
said	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
has	1
a	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
building	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
computation	1
has	1
do	1
with	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
relations	1
the	1
science	1
I	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
of	1
	1
said	1
	1
And	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
of	1
computation	1
	1
	1
The	1
of	1
again	1
has	1
do	1
with	1
and	1
the	1
said	1
what	1
is	1
of	1
computation	1
geometry	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
another	1
you	1
and	1
each	1
other	1
	1
	1
Now	1
I	1
want	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
which	1
is	1
wisdom	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
wisdom	1
is	1
the	1
science	1
	1
You	1
asking	1
in	1
what	1
wisdom	1
temperance	1
differs	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
you	1
some	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
of	1
they	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
else	1
and	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
itself	1
Admitting	1
itself	1
And	1
of	1
this	1
as	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
science	1
and	1
a	1
you	1
only	1
doing	1
what	1
you	1
you	1
were	1
doing	1
just	1
now	1
trying	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
	1
And	1
believe	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
just	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
Socrates	1
said	1
You	1
come	1
motive	1
be	1
just	1
a	1
fear	1
of	1
what	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
other	1
motive	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
And	1
this	1
moment	1
I	1
the	1
chiefly	1
own	1
and	1
perhaps	1
in	1
some	1
the	1
of	1
of	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
as	1
they	1
truly	1
a	1
good	1
common	1
all	1
mankind	1
	1
Socrates	1
said	1
	1
Then	1
I	1
said	1
be	1
cheerful	1
sir	1
and	1
give	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
asked	1
never	1
Critias	1
Socrates	1
is	1
I	1
knew	1
alike	1
	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
right	1
replied	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
should	1
the	1
person	1
refuted	1
only	1
the	1
and	1
	1
Tell	1
me	1
I	1
said	1
what	1
you	1
affirm	1
wisdom	1
	1
I	1
say	1
wisdom	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
science	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
itself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
what	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
	1
But	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
science	1
I	1
said	1
be	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
science	1
	1
said	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
other	1
For	1
is	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
be	1
examine	1
what	1
knows	1
does	1
know	1
and	1
what	1
know	1

do	1
know	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
they	1
do	1
No	1
other	1
person	1
be	1
do	1
this	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
wisdom	1
is	1
a	1
science	1
of	1
other	1
wisdom	1
wise	1
temperate	1
man	1
and	1
only	1

what	1
they	1
	1
said	1
	1
Now	1
I	1
said	1
an	1
of	1
the	1
the	1
Saviour	1
us	1
begin	1
again	1
and	1
in	1
the	1

That	1
is	1
what	1
have	1
consider	1
said	1
	1
And	1
Critias	1
I	1
said	1
and	1
temperance	1
a	1
difficulty	1
into	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
myself	1
Shall	1
I	1
you	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
difficulty	1
	1
By	1
all	1
replied	1
	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
That	1
is	1
is	1
possible	1
a	1
person	1
know	1
of	1

and	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1

	1
	1
But	1
consider	1
monstrous	1
this	1

In	1

	1
But	1
what	1
if	1

experience	1
me	1
love	1

they	1
imagine	1
either	1
they	1
in	1
	1
	1
Then	1
which	1

now	1
they	1

	1

	1
you	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
only	1
one	1

a	1

the	1

who	1
sings	1
	1
Happy	1
the	1

the	1

wrong	1
	1
You	1

	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
is	1
what	1

	1
I	1

what	1

Or	1
shall	1

one	1
	1
	1
And	1
the	1

Then	1
many	1

the	1

Yet	1

in	1
this	1
paradox	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
an	1
his	1

a	1
friend	1

	1
I	1
agree	1
Socrates	1
in	1
what	1
you	1

	1
But	1
if	1
this	1

the	1

True	1

if	1
so	1
the	1
the	1

	1
	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
instance	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
absurd	1
dear	1
friend	1
indeed	1
impossible	1

is	1
the	1

may	1

does	1
love	1

And	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
the	1

and	1
is	1
his	1

which	1
is	1
	1
That	1
one	1
who	1

if	1

the	1

what	1

	1
I	1

possibly	1
right	1
if	1

For	1
the	1
you	1

the	1

Then	1
now	1

the	1
That	1
the	1

	1
	1
I	1

I	1
am	1

who	1
is	1
be	1
a	1

	1
	1
But	1
say	1
the	1
like	1
is	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1
so	1
himself	1
is	1
like	1
the	1

may	1
be	1
the	1

who	1
is	1
a	1

no	1

they	1

	1
	1
But	1
now	1
being	1
deceived	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
indeed	1
another	1
	1
so	1
replied	1
	1
Have	1
I	1
heard	1
some	1
one	1
say	1
as	1
I	1
just	1
now	1
recollect	1
the	1
like	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
the	1
like	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
quoted	1
the	1
wrong	1
	1
Potter	1
with	1
hard	1
with	1
bard	1
	1
with	1
beggar	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
things	1
affirmed	1
in	1
like	1
That	1
said	1
is	1
necessity	1
the	1
most	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
friendship	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
compelled	1
be	1
the	1
is	1
value	1
of	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
the	1
requires	1
the	1
who	1
is	1
has	1
love	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
And	1
indeed	1
went	1
on	1
say	1
in	1
grandiloquent	1
of	1
who	1
says	1
friendship	1
similars	1
is	1
the	1
the	1
very	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
another	1
everything	1
desires	1
like	1
good	1
example	1
the	1
dry	1
desires	1
the	1
moist	1
the	1
the	1
the	1
the	1
the	1
sharp	1
the	1
the	1
void	1
the	1
the	1
the	1
void	1
and	1
be	1
value	1
one	1
another	1
the	1
opposite	1
whereas	1
like	1
receives	1
like	1
And	1
I	1
thought	1
who	1
said	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
do	1
the	1
of	1
you	1
say	1
	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
first	1
is	1
right	1
said	1
	1
Then	1
language	1
the	1
of	1
	1
	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
the	1
most	1
the	1
all	1
wise	1
be	1
us	1
in	1
and	1
fairly	1
enough	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
opposite	1
of	1
hate	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
so	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
things	1
say	1
the	1
greatest	1
friendship	1
is	1
of	1
opposites	1
	1
We	1
	1
the	1
is	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
spoke	1
well	1
What	1
	1
replied	1
	1
the	1
opposite	1
is	1
the	1
of	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
physician	1
and	1
one	1
	1
I	1
do	1
is	1
possible	1
	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
friendship	1
goes	1
friend	1
them	1
they	1
speak	1
the	1
be	1
	1
	1
Then	1
neither	1
like	1
and	1
like	1
and	1
	1
I	1
suppose	1
	1
And	1
is	1
is	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
the	1
temperate	1
notions	1
of	1
friendship	1
be	1
erroneous	1
be	1
a	1
monstrous	1
and	1
neither	1
good	1
evil	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
be	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
is	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
friend	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
the	1
is	1
the	1
friend	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
says	1
is	1
a	1
soft	1
slippery	1
thing	1
and	1
of	1
contraries	1
the	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
you	1
said	1
For	1
I	1
affirm	1
the	1

the	1
You	1
agree	1
	1
	1
I	1
say	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
neither	1

The	1

May	1
the	1

I	1

so	1
	1
And	1
the	1

dear	1
the	1
truly	1

in	1
which	1
all	1
these	1
so	1
called	1

For	1
if	1

Then	1
be	1

no	1
in	1
the	1

	1
I	1
suppose	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
final	1
of	1

in	1

all	1

	1
replied	1
I	1
which	1
relatively	1
dear	1
and	1
good	1
	1
But	1
you	1
me	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
evil	1
were	1
should	1
hunger	1
any	1
more	1
any	1
more	1

any	1
most	1
of	1

the	1

all	1
out	1

Or	1
may	1
suppose	1
is	1
improperly	1
said	1
any	1
they	1
the	1
similar	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
desires	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
because	1
evil	1
has	1
Or	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
what	1
either	1
be	1
be	1
is	1
who	1
knows	1
called	1
dear	1
because	1
of	1
another	1
dear	1

	1
	1
And	1
in	1
like	1
any	1
similar	1
so	1
as	1
be	1
hurtful	1
And	1
the	1

of	1
good	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
may	1
us	1
other	1
	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
	1
But	1
is	1
any	1
hunger	1
and	1
evil	1
should	1
with	1
	1
	1
Then	1
if	1
evil	1
perishes	1
the	1
desires	1
which	1
neither	1
good	1
evil	1
be	1
	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
love	1
which	1
desires	1
and	1
affects	1
	1
	1
Then	1
if	1
evil	1
perishes	1
may	1
some	1
of	1
love	1
friendship	1
	1
us	1
and	1
neither	1
one	1
the	1
	1
But	1
if	1
evil	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
friendship	1
in	1
be	1
the	1

of	1
any	1

the	1
destruction	1
of	1

be	1
a	1
	1
True	1
	1
And	1

already	1
the	1

opinion	1
the	1
neither	1

	1
	1
But	1
now	1
view	1
is	1
and	1
be	1
some	1
the	1

	1
I	1
suppose	1
so	1
	1
May	1
the	1

just	1
now	1

the	1

they	1

you	1

And	1
what	1

what	1
That	1

in	1
what	1

of	1
with	1
a	1

what	1

the	1
just	1
man	1
most	1
do	1
harm	1

who	1

No	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
on	1
a	1

has	1
no	1

No	1
Then	1
in	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
the	1
analogy	1
of	1
the	1
You	1

may	1
be	1

in	1
peace	1
as	1
well	1

in	1

shoemaking	1
the	1

what	1
you	1

what	1
peace	1
In	1
contracts	1
Socrates	1
is	1
of	1
In	1
against	1
the	1
one	1

in	1
alliances	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
But	1
is	1
the	1
just	1
man	1
the	1
skilful	1

a	1
more	1

better	1
a	1

of	1
The	1
skilful	1
player	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Like	1
thinking	1
so	1
better	1
than	1
the	1

the	1
Then	1
in	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
partnership	1
is	1
the	1
just	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
than	1
the	1
player	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
the	1
player	1
is	1
a	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
just	1
man	1
In	1
a	1
money	1
partnership	1
Polemarchus	1
surely	1
in	1
the	1
of	1
money	1
you	1
do	1
want	1

a	1

you	1

True	1
Then	1
what	1
is	1
joint	1
of	1

you	1

you	1

a	1
a	1

them	1
you	1

so	1
of	1
all	1
the	1

But	1
us	1
consider	1
this	1
further	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
most	1
skilful	1
in	1

who	1

you	1

the	1
Then	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
keeper	1
of	1
anything	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thief	1
That	1
I	1
suppose	1

be	1
Then	1
if	1
the	1
just	1

keeping	1

That	1
is	1
implied	1

of	1
fighting	1

a	1
lesson	1
which	1
I	1
you	1
have	1
out	1
of	1
Homer	1

so	1
you	1

an	1
all	1

this	1
And	1

be	1
practised	1
the	1

You	1

Then	1
us	1
now	1
the	1
purgation	1
I	1
said	1
Next	1
in	1
order	1
harmonies	1
naturally	1
follow	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
the	1

rules	1
of	1
of	1
what	1
the	1

a	1
like	1
spirit	1
me	1
the	1

indeed	1
replied	1
I	1
you	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
out	1
replied	1
some	1
three	1
principles	1
of	1
rhythm	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
systems	1
of	1
metre	1
metres	1
just	1
as	1
in	1

of	1

But	1
if	1
so	1
State	1
grow	1
in	1
a	1

I	1
think	1
you	1
right	1
I	1
wonder	1
you	1
agree	1
with	1
another	1
remark	1
which	1
me	1
What	1
may	1
be	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
deterioration	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
all	1
equally	1
with	1
them	1
be	1
compelled	1
What	1
they	1
Wealth	1
I	1
said	1
and	1
do	1
they	1
The	1
process	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
rich	1
think	1
is	1
speaking	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
grow	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
indolent	1
and	1
careless	1
And	1
the	1
be	1
a	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
order	1
and	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
if	1
whole	1
you	1
any	1
longer	1
the	1
same	1
pains	1
with	1
his	1
teach	1
his	1
sons	1
work	1
equally	1
well	1
Then	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
either	1
of	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
their	1
work	1
receive	1
the	1
of	1
which	1
nature	1
assigns	1
them	1
That	1
is	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
discovery	1
of	1
new	1
evils	1
I	1
said	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
have	1
they	1
greatly	1
What	1
evils	1
Wealth	1
I	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
and	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
replied	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
know	1
Socrates	1
instruments	1
work	1
equally	1
well	1
himself	1
who	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
if	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
has	1
be	1
into	1
the	1
with	1
one	1
is	1
no	1
difficulty	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
so	1
asked	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
have	1
be	1
especially	1
against	1
an	1
trained	1
fighting	1
against	1
an	1
of	1
rich	1
That	1
parent	1
of	1
luxury	1
and	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
Adeimantus	1
a	1
single	1
who	1
perfect	1
in	1
his	1
be	1
a	1
match	1
two	1
and	1
well	1
do	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
were	1
boxers	1
Hardly	1
if	1
they	1
equally	1
is	1
no	1
money	1
and	1
a	1
difficulty	1
I	1
replied	1
in	1
What	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
were	1
himself	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
first	1
And	1
supposing	1
were	1
do	1
this	1
several	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
personage	1
said	1
be	1
in	1
And	1
rich	1
probably	1
have	1
a	1
be	1
and	1
practice	1
of	1
boxing	1
than	1
they	1
have	1
in	1
military	1
qualities	1
Likely	1
enough	1
Then	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
two	1
three	1
their	1
under	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
a	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
turn	1
and	1
strike	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
right	1
And	1
suppose	1
engaging	1
an	1
said	1
neither	1

For	1
indeed	1

And	1
surely	1

Then	1

very	1

the	1
Impossible	1
Still	1
I	1

us	1
have	1
a	1
more	1

statement	1

lest	1
should	1
fall	1
out	1

in	1
the	1

may	1

the	1

of	1
anything	1

you	1

a	1

happens	1
And	1
in	1
bow	1
the	1

what	1
you	1

one	1

the	1

us	1

Glaucon	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
a	1
who	1
offers	1
these	1
objections	1

By	1

And	1
now	1
what	1

the	1

Yet	1

a	1

in	1

a	1

First	1
I	1

say	1
You	1
I	1
said	1
who	1
their	1
legislator	1
selected	1
the	1
now	1
select	1
the	1

give	1
them	1

be	1

associate	1
in	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
their	1

have	1
intercourse	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
	1
necessity	1
is	1
a	1
I	1
think	1
said	1
necessity	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
which	1
know	1

which	1
is	1
more	1
convincing	1

constraining	1

True	1
I	1
said	1

this	1
Glaucon	1

all	1
the	1

an	1
orderly	1
fashion	1
in	1
a	1

an	1

the	1

Then	1
the	1

be	1
sacred	1
in	1
the	1

what	1
is	1
most	1
be	1
sacred	1
And	1
said	1
and	1
ought	1
be	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
be	1
which	1
I	1
you	1
because	1
I	1

the	1

may	1

in	1

these	1

enactments	1
very	1
good	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
Socrates	1
if	1
you	1

you	1
forget	1
the	1

a	1

of	1

you	1
thrust	1
aside	1
an	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
possible	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
you	1
if	1

all	1

the	1

I	1
us	1
enact	1
this	1

they	1
neither	1
be	1
the	1
bravest	1
of	1

never	1
their	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
omitted	1
other	1
brother	1
son	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
suppose	1
the	1

join	1
their	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

all	1

a	1

is	1
the	1

respecting	1
a	1

which	1
I	1

The	1

you	1

I	1
only	1

you	1
now	1
bringing	1

The	1
approximation	1
be	1
enough	1
We	1
enquiring	1
into	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
absolute	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
character	1
Let	1
me	1
begin	1
reminding	1
you	1

hither	1
in	1
the	1
have	1
each	1
call	1
the	1
judge	1
of	1
own	1

unhappiness	1
according	1
the	1
standard	1
which	1
they	1
and	1
the	1
in	1

them	1
with	1
any	1

were	1
creating	1
an	1

of	1
a	1

State	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
And	1
is	1
a	1
because	1
unable	1
prove	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1

and	1
investigate	1
replied	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
I	1
said	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
show	1
and	1
under	1
what	1
conditions	1
the	1
possibility	1
is	1
I	1
you	1
this	1
in	1
view	1
repeat	1
What	1
I	1
want	1
know	1
ideals	1
man	1
the	1
express	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
perfectly	1
just	1

into	1
fully	1
realised	1
in	1
language	1
whatever	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
think	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
things	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
I	1
agree	1
Then	1
you	1
on	1
proving	1
the	1
State	1
in	1
coincide	1
with	1
the	1
ideal	1
the	1
a	1
may	1
be	1
governed	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
described	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
contented	1
you	1
I	1
Let	1
me	1
next	1
show	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
maladministration	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
which	1
enable	1
a	1
State	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
possibility	1
which	1
you	1
and	1
be	1
contented	1
the	1
if	1

the	1
truer	1
form	1

any	1

be	1
as	1
few	1

as	1
if	1
only	1
replied	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
said	1
be	1
a	1
reform	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
perfectly	1
one	1
were	1
made	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
easy	1
a	1
possible	1
one	1
What	1
is	1
said	1
Now	1
I	1
said	1
than	1
is	1
be	1
in	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
shall	1
the	1
be	1
spoken	1
the	1
wave	1
and	1
me	1
in	1
laughter	1
and	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
mark	1
words	1
I	1
said	1
Until	1
the	1

of	1
this	1

the	1

We	1

aside	1

power	1
of	1

as	1
I	1
believe	1
and	1
only	1
this	1
State	1
have	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1

Such	1
if	1
only	1
Glaucon	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
uttered	1
if	1
had	1
seemed	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
State	1
be	1
private	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
hard	1
thing	1
Socrates	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
never	1

the	1

in	1
a	1

I	1
which	1
I	1

And	1
these	1
in	1

I	1
never	1

The	1

no	1

And	1
you	1

the	1

And	1

the	1

says	1
her	1

only	1
a	1

this	1

be	1
more	1

You	1
me	1

described	1
his	1
origin	1
perfectly	1
Then	1
have	1
now	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
and	1
the	1
type	1
of	1
character	1
We	1
have	1
Next	1
us	1
look	1
another	1
man	1
who	1
as	1
Aeschylus	1
says	1
and	1
comparisons	1
of	1

is	1
begin	1
with	1
the	1
State	1
By	1
all	1
I	1
believe	1
oligarchy	1
next	1
in	1
order	1
And	1
what	1
of	1
do	1
you	1
resting	1
on	1
a	1
valuation	1
of	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
rich	1
have	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
of	1
I	1
understand	1
replied	1
I	1
begin	1
over	1
against	1
another	1
State	1
as	1
plan	1
requires	1
oligarchy	1
arises	1
I	1
said	1
no	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
one	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
The	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
treasury	1

private	1
is	1
encouraging	1
the	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
their	1
care	1
the	1
law	1
indeed	1
And	1
one	1
another	1
grow	1
rich	1
rival	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
money	1
Likely	1
enough	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
grow	1
and	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
fortune	1
the	1
oligarchy	1
ruin	1
the	1
of	1
timocracy	1
they	1
illegal	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
falls	1
True	1
And	1
in	1
as	1
and	1
rich	1
honoured	1
in	1
the	1
timocracy	1
virtue	1
and	1
the	1
dishonoured	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
honoured	1
is	1
cultivated	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
no	1
is	1
That	1
is	1
obvious	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
virtue	1
of	1
and	1
money	1
they	1
and	1
look	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
of	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
do	1
so	1
next	1
of	1
citizenship	1
the	1
sum	1
is	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
as	1
the	1
oligarchy	1
is	1
more	1
and	1
they	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
of	1
contention	1

force	1
of	1
if	1
has	1
already	1
done	1
their	1
work	1
And	1
this	1
speaking	1
generally	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
oligarchy	1
is	1
said	1
what	1
the	1
of	1
this	1
form	1
of	1
and	1
the	1
State	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
I	1
said	1
consider	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
just	1

a	1

fixes	1
a	1

as	1
the	1
You	1
they	1
shipwreck	1
and	1
is	1
this	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
anything	1
I	1
should	1
imagine	1
so	1
a	1
in	1

said	1
the	1

the	1

You	1

is	1
the	1

glorious	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
springs	1
tyranny	1
indeed	1
said	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
next	1
step	1
The	1
ruin	1
of	1
oligarchy	1
of	1
them	1
encourages	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
liberty	1
is	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
democracy	1
the	1

magnified	1
the	1
excessive	1

of	1
anything	1
a	1

The	1
of	1
liberty	1
in	1
of	1
all	1
pass	1
into	1
of	1
slavery	1
the	1
order	1
And	1
so	1
tyranny	1
naturally	1
arises	1
out	1
of	1
democracy	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
form	1
of	1
tyranny	1
and	1
slavery	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

As	1
expect	1
That	1
what	1
you	1
describe	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
disorder	1
which	1
is	1
alike	1
in	1
oligarchy	1
and	1
democracy	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
both	1
Just	1
so	1
overmasters	1
democracy	1
the	1
being	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
meant	1
seems	1
only	1

the	1

the	1
the	1

some	1

very	1
just	1
two	1
the	1
plagues	1

you	1
being	1
what	1
phlegm	1

the	1
And	1
the	1
good	1

their	1

Then	1
in	1

greatly	1

is	1
conceivable	1
the	1

Then	1
all	1
these	1

with	1

Or	1
if	1

already	1
observed	1
a	1
of	1
a	1
of	1

his	1
is	1
good	1
enough	1
who	1
know	1
no	1

so	1
they	1

of	1
military	1
of	1

and	1
rhythm	1
very	1
well	1
is	1
the	1
influence	1
which	1
and	1
rhythm	1
nature	1
have	1
And	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
have	1
observed	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
what	1
a	1
appearance	1
the	1
of	1
In	1
like	1

with	1
his	1

may	1
be	1
said	1
and	1
recited	1
in	1
prose	1
said	1
like	1
which	1
were	1
stripped	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
now	1
the	1
of	1
youth	1
has	1
away	1
them	1
Here	1
is	1
another	1
The	1
of	1
the	1
knows	1
of	1
have	1
allowed	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
Then	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
and	1
who	1
an	1
Of	1
the	1
say	1
and	1
a	1
And	1
the	1
in	1
and	1
brass	1
them	1
But	1
does	1
the	1
know	1
the	1
right	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
hardly	1
the	1
workers	1
in	1
with	1
them	1
never	1
only	1
who	1
knows	1
knows	1
appearances	1
only	1
Am	1
I	1
right	1
brass	1
and	1
who	1
them	1
only	1
the	1
What	1
That	1
three	1
which	1
concerned	1
with	1
all	1
things	1
one	1
which	1
uses	1
another	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
which	1
them	1
And	1
And	1
may	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
inanimate	1
and	1
of	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
relative	1
the	1
which	1
nature	1

has	1

Then	1
the	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
as	1
with	1
indicate	1
the	1
the	1
good	1
qualities	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
metre	1
in	1
example	1
the	1
flute	1
player	1
the	1
flute	1
which	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
animate	1
ought	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
Of	1
The	1
one	1
knows	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
and	1
of	1
flutes	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
told	1
True	1
The	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
True	1
who	1
knows	1
talking	1
and	1
being	1
compelled	1
hear	1
what	1
has	1
say	1
whereas	1
the	1
have	1
knowledge	1
True	1
But	1
the	1
have	1
experience	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
no	1
his	1
drawing	1
is	1
Or	1
flutes	1
is	1
satisfactory	1
the	1
being	1
compelled	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
should	1
Then	1
the	1
either	1
know	1
the	1
of	1
his	1
I	1
suppose	1
The	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
creations	1
very	1
the	1
And	1
on	1
knowing	1
what	1
makes	1
a	1
thing	1
good	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
only	1
which	1
be	1
good	1
the	1
Just	1
so	1
Thus	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
opinion	1
than	1
have	1
knowledge	1
worth	1
mentioning	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
associate	1
with	1
another	1
who	1
knows	1
and	1
gives	1
sport	1
and	1
the	1
tragic	1
they	1
write	1
in	1
in	1
imitators	1
in	1
the	1
And	1
now	1
me	1
I	1
you	1
has	1
imitation	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
be	1
concerned	1
with	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
in	1
have	1
right	1
opinion	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
I	1
explain	1
The	1
which	1
is	1
near	1
small	1
a	1
True	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
crooked	1
in	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
a	1
and	1
this	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
sight	1
is	1
Thus	1
sort	1
of	1
confusion	1
is	1
of	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
of	1
conjuring	1
and	1
of	1
deceiving	1
light	1
and	1
shadow	1
and	1
other	1
imposes	1
an	1
us	1
like	1
magic	1
True	1
within	1
well	1
agreed	1
the	1
has	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
is	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
more	1
no	1
longer	1
have	1
the	1
mastery	1
over	1
us	1
give	1
way	1
calculation	1
and	1
and	1
weight	1
And	1
this	1
surely	1
be	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
To	1
man	1
which	1
imitation	1
is	1
And	1
this	1
and	1
certifies	1
some	1
things	1
equal	1
some	1
greater	1
than	1
an	1
True	1
But	1
were	1
a	1

the	1

convex	1
owing	1
Then	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
has	1
an	1
opinion	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
the	1

True	1
And	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
the	1
is	1

be	1
sure	1
and	1

And	1
which	1
is	1
them	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inferior	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
No	1
which	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
seeking	1

the	1
inferior	1

And	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
sight	1
only	1
does	1
extend	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
what	1
Probably	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
of	1
I	1
doubt	1
us	1
examine	1
further	1
and	1
the	1
with	1
which	1
poetical	1
imitation	1
is	1
concerned	1
is	1
good	1
By	1
all	1
We	1
may	1
state	1
the	1
the	1
of	1
on	1
which	1
as	1
they	1

they	1
sorrow	1
the	1
anything	1
more	1
No	1
is	1

But	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
of	1
circumstances	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
unity	1
with	1
himself	1
us	1
and	1
this	1
is	1

in	1
his	1
the	1

things	1
so	1
is	1
and	1
inconsistency	1
in	1
his	1
Though	1
I	1
need	1
hardly	1
the	1
said	1
on	1
a	1
probability	1
the	1
analogy	1
of	1

acknowledged	1
us	1

of	1
these	1
and	1
ten	1
similar	1
oppositions	1
the	1

moment	1
And	1
were	1
right	1
said	1
accordingly	1
now	1
be	1
supplied	1
What	1
the	1
omission	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
misfortune	1
his	1

again	1
I	1
all	1
this	1

shall	1
say	1
although	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
healthy	1

The	1

the	1

statement	1
Tell	1

out	1
against	1

a	1

I	1

you	1
The	1

should	1
give	1
way	1
as	1

no	1

is	1
because	1
no	1
human	1

in	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
moment	1
is	1
most	1
What	1
is	1
most	1
asked	1
That	1

counsel	1
what	1

in	1
the	1
way	1
which	1

patient	1
under	1

best	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
instance	1
of	1
sight	1
confusion	1
the	1
a	1
which	1
is	1
and	1
banishing	1
the	1
cry	1
importance	1
and	1
grief	1
said	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
meeting	1
the	1
of	1
fortune	1
I	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
who	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
fall	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
inclines	1
us	1
recollection	1
of	1
of	1
sorrow	1
the	1
may	1
call	1
irrational	1
useless	1
and	1
cowardly	1
may	1
And	1
does	1
the	1
latter	1
a	1
great	1
of	1
imitation	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
being	1
is	1
easy	1
especially	1
a	1
festival	1
a	1

the	1

any	1

the	1

with	1

either	1
either	1
had	1
speak	1

off	1
	1

do	1
you	1

I	1

speaking	1

you	1

if	1
you	1

done	1
so	1
some	1
the	1
is	1
no	1
better	1
with	1
a	1
and	1
if	1
continues	1
you	1
twice	1
the	1
most	1
is	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
Aristophanes	1
and	1
now	1
on	1
	1
spoke	1
as	1
Pausanias	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
I	1
think	1
has	1
distinguished	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
love	1
But	1
further	1
me	1
the	1
double	1
love	1
is	1
with	1
and	1
and	1
if	1
is	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
of	1
the	1
I	1
do	1
both	1
said	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
turn	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
own	1
of	1
medicine	1
I	1
great	1
and	1
and	1
universal	1
is	1
the	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
in	1
all	1
is	1
is	1
the	1
whose	1
empire	1
over	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
human	1
And	1
an	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
man	1
the	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
these	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
confessedly	1
and	1
and	1
merely	1
which	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
healthy	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
is	1
another	1
and	1
as	1
Pausanias	1
a	1
in	1
indulge	1
good	1
is	1
honourable	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
healthy	1
be	1
indulged	1
and	1
the	1
and	1
the	1
of	1
be	1
indulged	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
physician	1
has	1
do	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
of	1
medicine	1
being	1
they	1
have	1
loves	1
and	1
desires	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
generally	1
as	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
loves	1
and	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
in	1
who	1
is	1
separate	1
love	1
one	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
eradicate	1
and	1
implant	1
love	1
whichever	1
is	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
and	1
them	1
just	1
now	1
skilful	1
practitioner	1
Now	1
the	1
most	1
consists	1
medicine	1
as	1
and	1
and	1
moist	1
and	1
dry	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
And	1
knowing	1
implant	1
friendship	1
and	1
accord	1
in	1
these	1
the	1
creator	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
us	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
them	1
and	1
only	1
medicine	1
is	1
the	1
of	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
	1
one	1
who	1
pays	1
the	1
least	1
attention	1
the	1
the	1
and	1
satisfy	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
physician	1
is	1
in	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
opposites	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
this	1
have	1
the	1
of	1
Heracleitus	1
although	1
his	1
words	1
says	1
is	1
united	1
disunion	1
like	1
the	1
of	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
lyre	1
the	1
most	1
opposite	1
an	1
absurdity	1
is	1
discord	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
discord	1
But	1
what	1
probably	1
meant	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
of	1
medicine	1
I	1
begin	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
which	1
disagreed	1
now	1
the	1
lame	1
I	1
his	1
if	1
the	1
and	1
disagreed	1
could	1
be	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
For	1
is	1
a	1
and	1
is	1
an	1
agreement	1
an	1
agreement	1
of	1
disagreements	1
they	1
which	1
In	1
like	1
rhythm	1
is	1
of	1
short	1
and	1
long	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
accord	1
which	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
instance	1
cases	1
love	1
and	1
grow	1
them	1
and	1
is	1
concerned	1
with	1
disagree	1
be	1
you	1
application	1
and	1
rhythm	1
Again	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
and	1
rhythm	1
is	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
love	1
which	1
has	1
double	1
But	1
you	1
want	1
them	1
in	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
in	1
metres	1
composed	1
already	1
which	1
latter	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
difficulty	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
is	1
needed	1
Then	1
the	1
old	1
has	1
be	1
repeated	1
of	1
and	1
heavenly	1
love	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
heavenly	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
love	1
in	1

the	1

be	1
with	1
circumspection	1
the	1
be	1
enjoyed	1
may	1
generate	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
own	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
matter	1
so	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

gratify	1
his	1

the	1

a	1

so	1
of	1
the	1
regarded	1

the	1

wise	1
I	1

the	1

if	1

Now	1
I	1

Agathon	1
I	1
no	1
I	1

I	1
shall	1
have	1
many	1
other	1

Socrates	1
Let	1
me	1
say	1
first	1
you	1
may	1
talk	1
and	1
speak	1
	1
The	1
speakers	1
of	1
praising	1
the	1
his	1
nature	1
appear	1
have	1
mankind	1
on	1
the	1
benefits	1
which	1
confers	1
them	1
But	1
I	1
the	1
especially	1
a	1
good	1
looking	1
one	1
no	1
longer	1
care	1
the	1
praising	1
everything	1
May	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
stage	1
with	1
the	1
the	1
blessed	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
of	1
love	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
want	1
of	1
refinement	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
aware	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
is	1
himself	1
the	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
who	1
is	1
enough	1
swifter	1
truly	1
than	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
like	1
and	1
come	1
near	1
youth	1
and	1
love	1
live	1
the	1
and	1
I	1
ought	1
speak	1
things	1
were	1
said	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
I	1
agree	1
is	1
than	1
Iapetus	1
and	1
Kronos	1
so	1
I	1
maintain	1
be	1
the	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
youthful	1
The	1
ancient	1
doings	1
the	1
of	1
best	1
And	1
is	1
the	1
fairest	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
is	1
the	1
the	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
were	1
done	1
of	1
Necessity	1
and	1
had	1
in	1
have	1
no	1
mutilation	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
violence	1
peace	1
and	1
most	1
blessed	1
because	1
is	1
the	1
fairest	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
of	1
	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
ought	1
have	1
a	1
like	1
Homer	1
describe	1
his	1
tenderness	1
as	1
and	1
	1
Her	1
sets	1
her	1
	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
tenderness	1
the	1
hard	1
the	1
soft	1
Let	1
us	1
a	1
similar	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
first	1
and	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
gifts	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
which	1
skulls	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
very	1
soft	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
both	1
and	1
which	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
the	1
in	1
them	1

dwells	1
and	1
makes	1
his	1
home	1
Not	1
in	1

hardness	1
departs	1
and	1
spoke	1
if	1
is	1

and	1
nestling	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
of	1
soft	1
be	1
other	1
with	1
his	1

as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
form	1
if	1
were	1
hard	1
and	1
could	1
all	1
things	1
wind	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
of	1
man	1
undiscovered	1
And	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
flexibility	1
and	1
the	1
universally	1
be	1
in	1
an	1
the	1
of	1
ungrace	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
The	1
fairness	1
of	1
his	1
complexion	1
is	1
his	1
habitation	1
the	1
flowers	1
dwells	1
amid	1
bloomless	1
fading	1
beauties	1
of	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
abides	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
enough	1
than	1
the	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
Of	1
a	1

the	1
tenderest	1
Of	1
his	1
virtue	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
speak	1
his	1
greatest	1
is	1
neither	1
do	1
wrong	1
any	1
any	1
man	1
suffers	1
force	1
if	1
suffers	1
force	1
near	1
neither	1
of	1
form	1
is	1
his	1
grace	1
which	1
is	1
serve	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
is	1
agreement	1
as	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
of	1
the	1
say	1
is	1
And	1
aught	1
else	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
flowers	1

Temperance	1
is	1
the	1
acknowledged	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1

no	1

as	1
Homer	1
says	1
of	1
Ate	1
is	1
their	1
and	1
they	1
his	1
and	1
if	1
them	1

indeed	1
As	1

the	1
of	1
War	1

no	1

For	1

the	1
more	1

I	1

	1
Of	1
his	1
courage	1

and	1
temperance	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
I	1
have	1
only	1

just	1
exceedingly	1
temperate	1
I	1
do	1
best	1
In	1
the	1

I	1
magnify	1

is	1
the	1

And	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
one	1

And	1
as	1
the	1

Socrates	1

Tell	1

I	1
a	1

The	1

Agathon	1

me	1

	1
dear	1
a	1
strait	1
who	1
has	1

has	1
heard	1
a	1
rich	1

discourse	1
I	1
am	1
especially	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1

who	1
could	1

I	1
the	1
on	1

run	1
away	1

if	1
had	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
escape	1
For	1
I	1
reminded	1
of	1
and	1
the	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
I	1
fancied	1
Agathon	1
shaking	1
me	1

Homer	1

And	1
I	1
I	1

in	1

into	1
praising	1

I	1
a	1

into	1
who	1
with	1
you	1

choose	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1

thinking	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
nature	1

I	1
now	1
the	1

the	1
better	1

no	1

the	1
original	1

them	1
in	1
the	1

And	1
I	1
felt	1
should	1
only	1
you	1
should	1
appear	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
form	1
of	1
which	1
be	1
and	1
you	1

	1
the	1

of	1
all	1
who	1

of	1
as	1
I	1
misunderstood	1
the	1

said	1
I	1
turn	1
I	1
beg	1
be	1
a	1
noble	1

solemn	1
of	1

you	1
But	1
made	1
in	1
and	1
which	1
as	1
Euripides	1
say	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
and	1
of	1
the	1

a	1
I	1
do	1
in	1

no	1
indeed	1
I	1
have	1
each	1

in	1
own	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
into	1
any	1
rivalry	1
with	1
you	1
Say	1
you	1
like	1
have	1
the	1
love	1
spoken	1
in	1
absolved	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
I	1
which	1
may	1
come	1
into	1
mind	1
the	1
be	1
agreeable	1
you	1
	1
Aristodemus	1
said	1
the	1
sleep	1
any	1
which	1
thought	1

any	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
any	1
order	1
first	1
Agathon	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
questions	1
in	1
order	1
I	1
may	1
his	1
as	1
the	1
of	1
discourse	1
	1
I	1
the	1
said	1
questions	1
Socrates	1
as	1
	1
In	1
the	1
magnificent	1
oration	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
uttered	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
right	1
dear	1
Agathon	1
in	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
bid	1
speak	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
very	1
approve	1
And	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
spoken	1
so	1
nature	1
may	1
I	1
you	1
further	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
of	1
And	1
I	1
explain	1
myself	1
I	1
do	1
want	1
you	1
say	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
be	1
as	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
asked	1
is	1
a	1
eloquently	1
best	1
of	1
first	1
and	1
afterwards	1
of	1
his	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
of	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
be	1
right	1
	1
said	1
Agathon	1
	1
And	1
you	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
a	1
	1
	1
Yet	1
me	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
a	1
brother	1
be	1
regarded	1
essentially	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1
a	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
find	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
	1
replied	1
	1
That	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
brother	1
	1
said	1
	1
And	1
now	1
said	1
Socrates	1
I	1
of	1
of	1
	1
Of	1
surely	1
replied	1
	1
in	1
mind	1
what	1
this	1
is	1
and	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
of	1
desires	1
of	1
which	1
love	1
is	1
	1
surely	1
	1
And	1
does	1
does	1
which	1
loves	1
and	1
desires	1
	1
Probably	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
	1
replied	1
Socrates	1
I	1
you	1
one	1
more	1
in	1
order	1
illustrate	1
	1
necessarily	1
is	1
the	1
The	1
who	1
desires	1
is	1
in	1
Then	1
me	1
have	1
is	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
is	1
in	1
Agathon	1
absolutely	1
and	1
necessarily	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Agathon	1
	1
good	1
Would	1
who	1
is	1
great	1
desire	1
be	1

who	1
is	1

of	1
his	1
	1
That	1
a	1
know	1
want	1
of	1
be	1
with	1
	1
True	1
For	1
have	1
you	1
consider	1
	1
And	1
Socrates	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
being	1

healthy	1

in	1

I	1

For	1
the	1
of	1
these	1
qualities	1
Agathon	1
be	1
supposed	1
have	1
their	1
respective	1
the	1
they	1
choose	1
and	1
who	1
desire	1

Therefore	1
a	1
person	1
says	1
I	1

and	1
be	1
well	1
be	1
be	1
rich	1
and	1

example	1
in	1
order	1

	1
replied	1
Agathon	1
	1
Then	1
said	1
Socrates	1
desires	1
what	1

may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1

with	1

	1
replied	1
	1
further	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
in	1
speech	1
if	1
you	1

the	1
and	1
of	1

if	1
this	1
is	1
	1
Then	1
you	1
say	1
love	1

Agathon	1
replied	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
	1
You	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
speech	1
Agathon	1
replied	1
Socrates	1
is	1
one	1
small	1
which	1
I	1
has	1
beauty	1
the	1
	1
	1
Then	1
in	1
wanting	1
the	1
love	1
the	1
good	1
	1
I	1
you	1

said	1
Agathon	1
Let	1
us	1
what	1
you	1

	1
Say	1
beloved	1
Socrates	1
is	1
refuted	1
	1
And	1
now	1
taking	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
rehearse	1
a	1
of	1
Agathon	1
you	1
the	1

I	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1

in	1
many	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1

She	1
instructress	1
in	1

if	1
the	1

I	1
made	1
the	1

woman	1
questioned	1
me	1
I	1
think	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
easiest	1
way	1

I	1
shall	1

I	1
As	1
you	1
Agathon	1

For	1

no	1
one	1

who	1
does	1
the	1

For	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
ought	1
do	1
as	1
own	1
slavish	1
state	1
But	1
this	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
if	1
I	1
I	1
his	1

the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1

And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1

I	1
should	1
be	1
more	1

is	1
of	1
all	1

is	1
the	1

Now	1
