10	 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE APOLLODORUS who repeats to his companion
11	the dialogue which he had heard from Aristodemus and had already once
12	narrated to Glaucon PHAEDRUS PAUSANIAS ERYXIMACHUS ARISTOPHANES 
13	AGATHON SOCRATES ALCIBIADES A TROOP OF REVELLERS Scene The
14	House of Agathon 
16	 Concerning the things about which you ask to be informed I believe
17	that I am not ill prepared with an answer For the day before
18	yesterday I was coming from my own home at Phalerum to the city and
19	one of my acquaintance who had caught a sight of me from behind 
20	hind out playfully in the distance said Apollodorus O thou
21	Phalerian man halt So I did as I was bid and then he said I was
22	looking for you Apollodorus only just now that I might ask you
23	about the speeches in praise of love which were delivered by
24	Socrates Alcibiades and others at Agathon s supper Phoenix the
25	son of Philip told another person who told me of them his
26	narrative was very indistinct but he said that you knew and I wish
27	that you would give me an account of them Who if not you should
28	be the reporter of the words of your friend And first tell me he
29	said were you present at this meeting 
31	 Your informant Glaucon I said must have been very indistinct
32	indeed if you imagine that the occasion was recent or that I could
33	have been of the party 
35	 Why yes he replied I thought so 
37	 Impossible I said Are you ignorant that for many years Agathon has
38	not resided at Athens and not three have elapsed since I became
39	acquainted with Socrates and have made it my daily business to know
40	all that he says and does There was a time when I was running about
41	the world fancying myself to be well employed but I was really a
42	most wretched thing no better than you are now I thought that I
43	ought to do anything rather than be a philosopher 
45	 Well he said jesting apart tell me when the meeting occurred 
47	 In our boyhood I replied when Agathon won the prize with his first
48	tragedy on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered
49	the sacrifice of victory 
51	 Then it must have been a long while ago he said and who told
52	you did Socrates 
54	 No indeed I replied but the same person who told Phoenix he was a
55	little fellow who never wore any shoes Aristodemus of the deme of
56	Cydathenaeum He had been at Agathon s feast and I think that in
57	those days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of
58	Socrates Moreover I have asked Socrates about the truth of some
59	parts of his narrative and he confirmed them Then said Glaucon let
60	us have the tale over again is not the road to Athens just made for
61	conversation And so we walked and talked of the discourses on
62	love and therefore as I said at first I am not ill prepared to
63	comply with your request and will have another rehearsal of them if
64	you like For to speak or to hear others speak of philosophy always
65	gives me the greatest pleasure to say nothing of the profit But when
66	I hear another strain especially that of you rich men and traders 
67	such conversation displeases me and I pity you who are my companions 
68	because you think that you are doing something when in reality you are
69	doing nothing And I dare say that you pity me in return whom you
70	regard as an unhappy creature and very probably you are right But
71	I certainly know of you what you only think of me there is the
72	difference 
74	 Companion I see Apollodorus that you are just the same always
75	speaking evil of yourself and of others and I do believe that you
76	pity all mankind with the exception of Socrates yourself first of
77	all true in this to your old name which however deserved I know how
78	you acquired of Apollodorus the madman for you are always raging
79	against yourself and everybody but Socrates 
81	 Apollodorus Yes friend and the reason why I am said to be mad 
82	and out of my wits is just because I have these notions of myself and
83	you no other evidence is required 
85	 Com No more of that Apollodorus but let me renew my request
86	that you would repeat the conversation 
88	 Apoll Well the tale of love was on this wise But perhaps I had
89	better begin at the beginning and endeavour to give you the exact
90	words of Aristodemus 
92	 He said that he met Socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled 
93	and as the sight of the sandals was unusual he asked him whither he
94	was going that he had been converted into such a beau 
96	 To a banquet at Agathon s he replied whose invitation to his
97	sacrifice of victory I refused yesterday fearing a crowd but
98	promising that I would come to day instead and so I have put on my
99	finery because he is such a fine man What say you to going with me
100	unasked 
102	 I will do as you bid me I replied 
104	 Follow then he said and let us demolish the proverb 
106	 To the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go 
108	instead of which our proverb will run 
110	 To the feasts of the good the good unbidden go 
112	and this alteration may be supported by the authority of Homer
113	himself who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb 
114	For after picturing Agamemnon as the most valiant of men he makes
115	Menelaus who is but a fainthearted warrior come unbidden to the
116	banquet of Agamemnon who is feasting and offering sacrifices not the
117	better to the worse but the worse to the better 
119	 I rather fear Socrates said Aristodemus lest this may still be my
120	case and that like Menelaus in Homer I shall be the inferior
121	person who
123	 To the leasts of the wise unbidden goes 
125	But I shall say that I was bidden of you and then you will have to
126	make an excuse 
128	 Two going together 
130	he replied in Homeric fashion one or other of them may invent an
131	excuse by the way 
133	 This was the style of their conversation as they went along 
134	Socrates dropped behind in a fit of abstraction and desired
135	Aristodemus who was waiting to go on before him When he reached the
136	house of Agathon he found the doors wide open and a comical thing
137	happened A servant coming out met him and led him at once into the
138	banqueting hall in which the guests were reclining for the banquet
139	was about to begin Welcome Aristodemus said Agathon as soon as
140	he appeared you are just in time to sup with us if you come on any
141	other matter put it off and make one of us as I was looking for
142	you yesterday and meant to have asked you if I could have found
143	you But what have you done with Socrates 
145	 I turned round but Socrates was nowhere to be seen and I had to
146	explain that he had been with me a moment before and that I came by
147	his invitation to the supper 
149	 You were quite right in coming said Agathon but where is he
150	himself 
152	 He was behind me just now as I entered he said and I cannot think
153	what has become of him 
155	 Go and look for him boy said Agathon and bring him in and do
156	you Aristodemus meanwhile take the place by Eryximachus 
158	 The servant then assisted him to wash and he lay down and
159	presently another servant came in and reported that our friend
160	Socrates had retired into the portico of the neighbouring house 
161	 There he is fixed said he and when I call to him he will not
162	stir 
164	 How strange said Agathon then you must call him again and keep
165	calling him 
167	 Let him alone said my informant he has a way of stopping
168	anywhere and losing himself without any reason I believe that he will
169	soon appear do not therefore disturb him 
171	 Well if you think so I will leave him said Agathon And then 
172	turning to the servants he added Let us have supper without waiting
173	for him Serve up whatever you please for there is no one to give
174	you orders hitherto I have never left you to yourselves But on
175	this occasion imagine that you art our hosts and that I and the
176	company are your guests treat us well and then we shall commend
177	you After this supper was served but still no Socrates and during
178	the meal Agathon several times expressed a wish to send for him but
179	Aristodemus objected and at last when the feast was about half
180	over for the fit as usual was not of long duration Socrates entered 
181	Agathon who was reclining alone at the end of the table begged
182	that he would take the place next to him that I may touch you he
183	said and have the benefit of that wise thought which came into
184	your mind in the portico and is now in your possession for I am
185	certain that you would not have come away until you had found what you
186	sought 
188	 How I wish said Socrates taking his place as he was desired 
189	that wisdom could be infused by touch out of the fuller the emptier
190	man as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier
191	one if that were so how greatly should I value the privilege of
192	reclining at your side For you would have filled me full with a
193	stream of wisdom plenteous and fair whereas my own is of a very
194	mean and questionable sort no better than a dream But yours is
195	bright and full of promise and was manifested forth in all the
196	splendour of youth the day before yesterday in the presence of more
197	than thirty thousand Hellenes 
199	 You are mocking Socrates said Agathon and ere long you and I will
200	have to determine who bears off the palm of wisdom of this Dionysus
201	shall be the judge but at present you are better occupied with
202	supper 
204	 Socrates took his place on the couch and supped with the rest 
205	and then libations were offered and after a hymn had been sung to the
206	god and there had been the usual ceremonies they were about to
207	commence drinking when Pausanias said And now my friends how can
208	we drink with least injury to ourselves I can assure you that I
209	feel severely the effect of yesterday s potations and must have
210	time to recover and I suspect that most of you are in the same
211	predicament for you were of the party yesterday Consider then How
212	can the drinking be made easiest 
214	 I entirely agree said Aristophanes that we should by all means 
215	avoid hard drinking for I was myself one of those who were
216	yesterday drowned in drink 
218	 I think that you are right said Eryximachus the son of Acumenus 
219	but I should still like to hear one other person speak Is Agathon
220	able to drink hard 
222	 I am not equal to it said Agathon 
224	 Then the Eryximachus the weak heads like myself Aristodemus 
225	Phaedrus and others who never can drink are fortunate in finding
226	that the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood I do not include
227	Socrates who is able either to drink or to abstain and will not
228	mind whichever we do Well as of none of the company seem
229	disposed to drink much I may be forgiven for saying as a
230	physician that drinking deep is a bad practice which I never follow 
231	if I can help and certainly do not recommend to another least of all
232	to any one who still feels the effects of yesterday s carouse 
234	 I always do what you advise and especially what you prescribe as
235	a physician rejoined Phaedrus the Myrrhinusian and the rest of the
236	company if they are wise will do the same 
238	 It was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day 
239	but that they were all to drink only so much as they pleased 
241	 Then said Eryximachus as you are all agreed that drinking is to be
242	voluntary and that there is to be no compulsion I move in the
243	next place that the flute girl who has just made her appearance 
244	be told to go away and play to herself or if she likes to the women
245	who are within To day let us have conversation instead and if you
246	will allow me I will tell you what sort of conversation This
247	proposal having been accepted Eryximachus proceeded as follows 
249	 I will begin he said after the manner of Melanippe in Euripides 
251	 Not mine the word
253	which I am about to speak but that of Phaedrus For often he says
254	to me in an indignant tone What a strange thing it is 
255	Eryximachus that whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in
256	their honour the great and glorious god Love has no encomiast among
257	all the poets who are so many There are the worthy sophists too the
258	excellent Prodicus for example who have descanted in prose on the
259	virtues of Heracles and other heroes and what is still more
260	extraordinary I have met with a philosophical work in which the
261	utility of salt has been made the theme of an eloquent discourse 
262	and many other like things have had a like honour bestowed upon
263	them And only to think that there should have been an eager
264	interest created about them and yet that to this day no one has
265	ever dared worthily to hymn Love s praises So entirely has this great
266	deity been neglected Now in this Phaedrus seems to me to be quite
267	right and therefore I want to offer him a contribution also I
268	think that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot do
269	better than honour the god Love If you agree with me there will
270	be no lack of conversation for I mean to propose that each of us in
271	turn going from left to right shall make a speech in honour of Love 
272	Let him give us the best which he can and Phaedrus because he is
273	sitting first on the left hand and because he is the father of the
274	thought shall begin 
276	 No one will vote against you Eryximachus said Socrates How can
277	I oppose your motion who profess to understand nothing but matters of
278	love nor I presume will Agathon and Pausanias and there can be
279	no doubt of Aristophanes whose whole concern is with Dionysus and
280	Aphrodite nor will any one disagree of those whom I see around me 
281	The proposal as I am aware may seem rather hard upon us whose
282	place is last but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches
283	first Let Phaedrus begin the praise of Love and good luck to him 
284	All the company expressed their assent and desired him to do as
285	Socrates bade him 
287	 Aristodemus did not recollect all that was said nor do I
288	recollect all that he related to me but I will tell you what I
289	thought most worthy of remembrance and what the chief speakers said 
291	 Phaedrus began by affirming that love is a mighty god and wonderful
292	among gods and men but especially wonderful in his birth For he is
293	the eldest of the gods which is an honour to him and a proof of
294	his claim to this honour is that of his parents there is no memorial 
295	neither poet nor prose writer has ever affirmed that he had any As
296	Hesiod says 
298	 First Chaos came and then broad bosomed Earth 
300	 The everlasting seat of all that is 
302	 And Love 
304	In other words after Chaos the Earth and Love these two came
305	into being Also Parmenides sings of Generation 
307	 First in the train of gods he fashioned Love 
309	And Acusilaus agrees with Hesiod Thus numerous are the witnesses
310	who acknowledge Love to be the eldest of the gods And not only is
311	he the eldest he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us 
312	For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning
313	life than a virtuous lover or to the lover than a beloved youth For
314	the principle which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly
315	live at principle I say neither kindred nor honour nor wealth nor
316	any other motive is able to implant so well as love Of what am I
317	speaking Of the sense of honour and dishonour without which
318	neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work And I
319	say that a lover who is detected in doing any dishonourable act or
320	submitting through cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by
321	another will be more pained at being detected by his beloved than
322	at being seen by his father or by his companions or by any one else 
323	The beloved too when he is found in any disgraceful situation has
324	the same feeling about his lover And if there were only some way of
325	contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and
326	their loves they would be the very best governors of their own
327	city abstaining from all dishonour and emulating one another in
328	honour and when fighting at each other s side although a mere
329	handful they would overcome the world For what lover would not
330	choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved either
331	when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms He would be
332	ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this Or who would
333	desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger The veriest
334	coward would become an inspired hero equal to the bravest at such
335	a time Love would inspire him That courage which as Homer says the
336	god breathes into the souls of some heroes Love of his own nature
337	infuses into the lover 
339	 Love will make men dare to die for their beloved love alone and
340	women as well as men Of this Alcestis the daughter of Pelias is
341	a monument to all Hellas for she was willing to lay down her life
342	on behalf of her husband when no one else would although he had a
343	father and mother but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded
344	theirs that she made them seem to be strangers in blood to their
345	own son and in name only related to him and so noble did this action
346	of hers appear to the gods as well as to men that among the many who
347	have done virtuously she is one of the very few to whom in admiration
348	of her noble action they have granted the privilege of returning
349	alive to earth such exceeding honour is paid by the gods to the
350	devotion and virtue of love But Orpheus the son of Oeagrus the
351	harper they sent empty away and presented to him an apparition
352	only of her whom he sought but herself they would not give up 
353	because he showed no spirit he was only a harp player and did
354	not dare like Alcestis to die for love but was contriving how he
355	might enter hades alive moreover they afterwards caused him to
356	suffer death at the hands of women as the punishment of his
357	cowardliness Very different was the reward of the true love of
358	Achilles towards his lover Patroclus his lover and not his love the
359	notion that Patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into
360	which Aeschylus has fallen for Achilles was surely the fairer of
361	the two fairer also than all the other heroes and as Homer
362	informs us he was still beardless and younger far And greatly as
363	the gods honour the virtue of love still the return of love on the
364	part of the beloved to the lover is more admired and valued and
365	rewarded by them for the lover is more divine because he is inspired
366	by God Now Achilles was quite aware for he had been told by his
367	mother that he might avoid death and return home and live to a
368	good old age if he abstained from slaying Hector Nevertheless he
369	gave his life to revenge his friend and dared to die not only in his
370	defence but after he was dead Wherefore the gods honoured him even
371	above Alcestis and sent him to the Islands of the Blest These are my
372	reasons for affirming that Love is the eldest and noblest and
373	mightiest of the gods and the chiefest author and giver of virtue
374	in life and of happiness after death 
376	 This or something like this was the speech of Phaedrus and some
377	other speeches followed which Aristodemus did not remember the next
378	which he repeated was that of Pausanias Phaedrus he said the
379	argument has not been set before us I think quite in the right
380	form we should not be called upon to praise Love in such an
381	indiscriminate manner If there were only one Love then what you said
382	would be well enough but since there are more Loves than
383	one should have begun by determining which of them was to be the
384	theme of our praises I will amend this defect and first of all I
385	would tell you which Love is deserving of praise and then try to hymn
386	the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him For we all know that
387	Love is inseparable from Aphrodite and if there were only one
388	Aphrodite there would be only one Love but as there are two goddesses
389	there must be two Loves 
391	 And am I not right in asserting that there are two goddesses The
392	elder one having no mother who is called the heavenly
393	Aphrodite she is the daughter of Uranus the younger who is the
394	daughter of Zeus and Dione her we call common and the Love who is her
395	fellow worker is rightly named common as the other love is called
396	heavenly All the gods ought to have praise given to them but not
397	without distinction of their natures and therefore I must try to
398	distinguish the characters of the two Loves Now actions vary
399	according to the manner of their performance Take for example 
400	that which we are now doing drinking singing and talking these
401	actions are not in themselves either good or evil but they turn out
402	in this or that way according to the mode of performing them and when
403	well done they are good and when wrongly done they are evil and in
404	like manner not every love but only that which has a noble purpose 
405	is noble and worthy of praise The Love who is the offspring of the
406	common Aphrodite is essentially common and has no discrimination 
407	being such as the meaner sort of men feel and is apt to be of women
408	as well as of youths and is of the body rather than of the soul the
409	most foolish beings are the objects of this love which desires only to
410	gain an end but never thinks of accomplishing the end nobly and
411	therefore does good and evil quite indiscriminately The goddess who
412	is his mother is far younger than the other and she was born of the
413	union of the male and female and partakes of both 
415	 But the offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite is derived from a mother
416	in whose birth the female has no part she is from the male only this
417	is that love which is of youths and the goddess being older there is
418	nothing of wantonness in her Those who are inspired by this love turn
419	to the male and delight in him who is the more valiant and
420	intelligent nature any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in
421	the very character of their attachments For they love not boys but
422	intelligent beings whose reason is beginning to be developed much
423	about the time at which their beards begin to grow And in choosing
424	young men to be their companions they mean to be faithful to them 
425	and pass their whole life in company with them not to take them in
426	their inexperience and deceive them and play the fool with them 
427	or run away from one to another of them But the love of young boys
428	should be forbidden by law because their future is uncertain they
429	may turn out good or bad either in body or soul and much noble
430	enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them in this matter the good are a
431	law to themselves and the coarser sort of lovers ought to be
432	restrained by force as we restrain or attempt to restrain them from
433	fixing their affections on women of free birth These are the
434	persons who bring a reproach on love and some have been led to deny
435	the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety
436	and evil of them for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully
437	done can justly be censured 
439	 Now here and in Lacedaemon the rules about love are perplexing 
440	but in most cities they are simple and easily intelligible in Elis
441	and Boeotia and in countries having no gifts of eloquence they are
442	very straightforward the law is simply in favour of these connexions 
443	and no one whether young or old has anything to say to their
444	discredit the reason being as I suppose that they are men of few
445	words in those parts and therefore the lovers do not like the trouble
446	of pleading their suit In Ionia and other places and generally in
447	countries which are subject to the barbarians the custom is held to
448	be dishonourable loves of youths share the evil repute in which
449	philosophy and gymnastics are held because they are inimical to
450	tyranny for the interests of rulers require that their subjects
451	should be poor in spirit and that there should be no strong bond of
452	friendship or society among them which love above all other motives 
453	is likely to inspire as our Athenian tyrants learned by experience 
454	for the love of Aristogeiton and the constancy of Harmodius had
455	strength which undid their power And therefore the ill repute
456	into which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evil
457	condition of those who make them to be ill reputed that is to say to
458	the self seeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed 
459	on the other hand the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in
460	some countries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold
461	this opinion of them In our own country a far better principle
462	prevails but as I was saying the explanation of it is rather
463	perplexing For observe that open loves are held to be more
464	honourable than secret ones and that the love of the noblest and
465	highest even if their persons are less beautiful than others is
466	especially honourable 
468	 Consider too how great is the encouragement which all the world
469	gives to the lover neither is he supposed to be doing anything
470	dishonourable but if he succeeds he is praised and if he fail he
471	is blamed And in the pursuit of his love the custom of mankind allows
472	him to do many strange things which philosophy would bitterly censure
473	if they were done from any motive of interest or wish for office or
474	power He may pray and entreat and supplicate and swear and lie on
475	a mat at the door and endure a slavery worse than that of any
476	slave in any other case friends and enemies would be equally ready
477	to prevent him but now there is no friend who will be ashamed of
478	him and admonish him and no enemy will charge him with meanness or
479	flattery the actions of a lover have a grace which ennobles them and
480	custom has decided that they are highly commendable and that there
481	no loss of character in them and what is strangest of all he only
482	may swear and forswear himself so men say and the gods will forgive
483	his transgression for there is no such thing as a lover s oath 
484	Such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the
485	lover according to the custom which prevails in our part of the
486	world From this point of view a man fairly argues in Athens to love
487	and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing But when
488	parents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers and place them
489	under a tutor s care who is appointed to see to these things and
490	their companions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort
491	which they may observe and their elders refuse to silence the
492	reprovers and do not rebuke them any one who reflects on all this
493	will on the contrary think that we hold these practices to be most
494	disgraceful But as I was saying at first the truth as I imagine is 
495	that whether such practices are honourable or whether they are
496	dishonourable is not a simple question they are honourable to him who
497	follows them honourably dishonourable to him who follows them
498	dishonourably There is dishonour in yielding to the evil or in an
499	evil manner but there is honour in yielding to the good or in an
500	honourable manner 
502	 Evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul 
503	inasmuch as he is not even stable because he loves a thing which is
504	in itself unstable and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was
505	desiring is over he takes wing and flies away in spite of all his
506	words and promises whereas the love of the noble disposition is
507	life long for it becomes one with the everlasting The custom of
508	our country would have both of them proven well and truly and would
509	have us yield to the one sort of lover and avoid the other and
510	therefore encourages some to pursue and others to fly testing both
511	the lover and beloved in contests and trials until they show to which
512	of the two classes they respectively belong And this is the reason
513	why in the first place a hasty attachment is held to be
514	dishonourable because time is the true test of this as of most
515	other things and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by
516	the love of money or of wealth or of political power whether a
517	man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them or having
518	experienced the benefits of money and political corruption is
519	unable to rise above the seductions of them For none of these
520	things are of a permanent or lasting nature not to mention that no
521	generous friendship ever sprang from them There remains then only
522	one way of honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved 
523	and this is the way of virtue for as we admitted that any service
524	which the lover does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a
525	dishonour to himself so the beloved has one way only of voluntary
526	service which is not dishonourable and this is virtuous service 
528	 For we have a custom and according to our custom any one who does
529	service to another under the idea that he will be improved by him
530	either in wisdom or in some other particular of virtue such a
531	voluntary service I say is not to be regarded as a dishonour and is
532	not open to the charge of flattery And these two customs one the
533	love of youth and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue
534	in general ought to meet in one and then the beloved may
535	honourably indulge the lover For when the lover and beloved come
536	together having each of them a law and the lover thinks that he is
537	right in doing any service which he can to his gracious loving one 
538	and the other that he is right in showing any kindness which he can to
539	him who is making him wise and good the one capable of
540	communicating wisdom and virtue the other seeking to acquire them
541	with a view to education and wisdom when the two laws of love are
542	fulfilled and meet in one then and then only may the beloved yield
543	with honour to the lover Nor when love is of this disinterested
544	sort is there any disgrace in being deceived but in every other
545	case there is equal disgrace in being or not being deceived For he
546	who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich and
547	is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor is
548	disgraced all the same for he has done his best to show that he would
549	give himself up to any one s uses base for the sake of money but
550	this is not honourable And on the same principle he who gives himself
551	to a lover because he is a good man and in the hope that he will be
552	improved by his company shows himself to be virtuous even though the
553	object of his affection turn out to be a villain and to have no
554	virtue and if he is deceived he has committed a noble error For he
555	has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a
556	view to virtue and improvement than which there can be nothing
557	nobler Thus noble in every case is the acceptance of another for
558	the sake of virtue This is that love which is the love of the
559	heavenly godess and is heavenly and of great price to individuals
560	and cities making the lover and the beloved alike eager in the work
561	of their own improvement But all other loves are the offspring of the
562	other who is the common goddess To you Phaedrus I offer this my
563	contribution in praise of love which is as good as I could make
564	extempore 
566	 Pausanias came to a pause this is the balanced way in which I have
567	been taught by the wise to speak and Aristodemus said that the turn
568	of Aristophanes was next but either he had eaten too much or from
569	some other cause he had the hiccough and was obliged to change
570	turns with Eryximachus the physician who was reclining on the couch
571	below him Eryximachus he said you ought either to stop my hiccough 
572	or to speak in my turn until I have left off 
574	 I will do both said Eryximachus I will speak in your turn and
575	do you speak in mine and while I am speaking let me recommend you
576	to hold your breath and if after you have done so for some time the
577	hiccough is no better then gargle with a little water and if it
578	still continues tickle your nose with something and sneeze and if
579	you sneeze once or twice even the most violent hiccough is sure to
580	go I will do as you prescribe said Aristophanes and now get on 
582	 Eryximachus spoke as follows Seeing that Pausanias made a fair
583	beginning and but a lame ending I must endeavour to supply his
584	deficiency I think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of
585	love But my art further informs me that the double love is not merely
586	an affection of the soul of man towards the fair or towards anything 
587	but is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions
588	of the earth and I may say in all that is such is the conclusion
589	which I seem to have gathered from my own art of medicine whence I
590	learn how great and wonderful and universal is the deity of love 
591	whose empire extends over all things divine as well as human And
592	from medicine I would begin that I may do honour to my art There
593	are in the human body these two kinds of love which are confessedly
594	different and unlike and being unlike they have loves and desires
595	which are unlike and the desire of the healthy is one and the desire
596	of the diseased is another and as Pausanias was just now saying
597	that to indulge good men is honourable and bad men
598	dishonourable so too in the body the good and healthy elements are to
599	be indulged and the bad elements and the elements of disease are
600	not to be indulged but discouraged And this is what the physician
601	has to do and in this the art of medicine consists for medicine
602	may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves and desires of
603	the body and how to satisfy them or not and the best physician is he
604	who is able to separate fair love from foul or to convert one into
605	the other and he who knows how to eradicate and how to implant
606	love whichever is required and can reconcile the most hostile
607	elements in the constitution and make them loving friends is
608	skilful practitioner Now the most hostile are the most opposite 
609	such as hot and cold bitter and sweet moist and dry and the like 
610	And my ancestor Asclepius knowing how to implant friendship and
611	accord in these elements was the creator of our art as our friends
612	the poets here tell us and I believe them and not only medicine in
613	every branch but the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his
614	dominion 
616	 Any one who pays the least attention to the subject will also
617	perceive that in music there is the same reconciliation of
618	opposites and I suppose that this must have been the meaning of
619	Heracleitus although his words are not accurate for he says that is
620	united by disunion like the harmony of bow and the lyre Now there is
621	an absurdity saying that harmony is discord or is composed of elements
622	which are still in a state of discord But what he probably meant was 
623	that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower
624	pitch which disagreed once but are now reconciled by the art of
625	music for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed there
626	could be there could be no harmony clearly not For harmony is a
627	symphony and symphony is an agreement but an agreement of
628	disagreements while they disagree there cannot be you cannot
629	harmonize that which disagrees In like manner rhythm is compounded of
630	elements short and long once differing and now in accord which
631	accordance as in the former instance medicine so in all these other
632	cases music implants making love and unison to grow up among them 
633	and thus music too is concerned with the principles of love in their
634	application to harmony and rhythm Again in the essential nature of
635	harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has
636	not yet become double But when you want to use them in actual life 
637	either in the composition of songs or in the correct performance of
638	airs or metres composed already which latter is called education 
639	then the difficulty begins and the good artist is needed Then the
640	old tale has to be repeated of fair and heavenly love the love of
641	Urania the fair and heavenly muse and of the duty of accepting the
642	temperate and those who are as yet intemperate only that they may
643	become temperate and of preserving their love and again of the
644	vulgar Polyhymnia who must be used with circumspection that the
645	pleasure be enjoyed but may not generate licentiousness just as in
646	my own art it is a great matter so to regulate the desires of the
647	epicure that he may gratify his tastes without the attendant evil of
648	disease Whence I infer that in music in medicine in all other
649	things human as which as divine both loves ought to be noted as far
650	as may be for they are both present 
652	 The course of the seasons is also full of both these principles and
653	when as I was saying the elements of hot and cold moist and dry 
654	attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance
655	and harmony they bring to men animals and plants health and plenty 
656	and do them no harm whereas the wanton love getting the upper hand
657	and affecting the seasons of the year is very destructive and
658	injurious being the source of pestilence and bringing many other
659	kinds of diseases on animals and plants for hoar frost and hail and
660	blight spring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of
661	love which to know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly
662	bodies and the seasons of the year is termed astronomy Furthermore
663	all sacrifices and the whole province of divination which is the
664	art of communion between gods and men these I say are concerned with
665	the preservation of the good and the cure of the evil love For all
666	manner of impiety is likely to ensue if instead of accepting and
667	honouring and reverencing the harmonious love in all his actions a
668	man honours the other love whether in his feelings towards gods or
669	parents towards the living or the dead Wherefore the business of
670	divination is to see to these loves and to heal them and divination
671	is the peacemaker of gods and men working by a knowledge of the
672	religious or irreligious tendencies which exist in human loves Such
673	is the great and mighty or rather omnipotent force of love in
674	general And the love more especially which is concerned with the
675	good and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice 
676	whether among gods or men has the greatest power and is the source
677	of all our happiness and harmony and makes us friends with the gods
678	who are above us and with one another I dare say that I too have
679	omitted several things which might be said in praise of Love but this
680	was not intentional and you Aristophanes may now supply the
681	omission or take some other line of commendation for I perceive
682	that you are rid of the hiccough 
684	 Yes said Aristophanes who followed the hiccough is gone not 
685	however until I applied the sneezing and I wonder whether the
686	harmony of the body has a love of such noises and ticklings for I
687	no sooner applied the sneezing than I was cured 
689	 Eryximachus said Beware friend Aristophanes although you are
690	going to speak you are making fun of me and I shall have to watch
691	and see whether I cannot have a laugh at your expense when you
692	might speak in peace 
694	 You are right said Aristophanes laughing I will unsay my words 
695	but do you please not to watch me as I fear that in the speech
696	which I am about to make instead of others laughing with me which is
697	to the manner born of our muse and would be all the better I shall
698	only be laughed at by them 
700	 Do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape Aristophanes Well 
701	perhaps if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be
702	called to account I may be induced to let you off 
704	 Aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse he had a
705	mind to praise Love in another way unlike that either of Pausanias or
706	Eryximachus Mankind he said judging by their neglect of him have
707	never as I think at all understood the power of Love For if they
708	had understood him they would surely have built noble temples and
709	altars and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour but this is not
710	done and most certainly ought to be done since of all the gods he is
711	the best friend of men the helper and the healer of the ills which
712	are the great impediment to the happiness of the race I will try to
713	describe his power to you and you shall teach the rest of the world
714	what I am teaching you In the first place let me treat of the nature
715	of man and what has happened to it for the original human nature
716	was not like the present but different The sexes were not two as
717	they are now but originally three in number there was man woman 
718	and the union of the two having a name corresponding to this double
719	nature which had once a real existence but is now lost and the word
720	 Androgynous is only preserved as a term of reproach In the second
721	place the primeval man was round his back and sides forming a
722	circle and he had four hands and four feet one head with two
723	faces looking opposite ways set on a round neck and precisely alike 
724	also four ears two privy members and the remainder to correspond He
725	could walk upright as men now do backwards or forwards as he pleased 
726	and he could also roll over and over at a great pace turning on his
727	four hands and four feet eight in all like tumblers going over and
728	over with their legs in the air this was when he wanted to run
729	fast Now the sexes were three and such as I have described them 
730	because the sun moon and earth are three and the man was originally
731	the child of the sun the woman of the earth and the man woman of the
732	moon which is made up of sun and earth and they were all round and
733	moved round and round like their parents Terrible was their might
734	and strength and the thoughts of their hearts were great and they
735	made an attack upon the gods of them is told the tale of Otys and
736	Ephialtes who as Homer says dared to scale heaven and would have
737	laid hands upon the gods Doubt reigned in the celestial councils 
738	Should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts as
739	they had done the giants then there would be an end of the sacrifices
740	and worship which men offered to them but on the other hand the
741	gods could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained 
743	 At last after a good deal of reflection Zeus discovered a way 
744	He said Methinks I have a plan which will humble their pride and
745	improve their manners men shall continue to exist but I will cut
746	them in two and then they will be diminished in strength and increased
747	in numbers this will have the advantage of making them more
748	profitable to us They shall walk upright on two legs and if they
749	continue insolent and will not be quiet I will split them again and
750	they shall hop about on a single leg He spoke and cut men in two 
751	like a sorb apple which is halved for pickling or as you might divide
752	an egg with a hair and as he cut them one after another he bade
753	Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn in order that the
754	man might contemplate the section of himself he would thus learn a
755	lesson of humility Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and
756	compose their forms So he gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin
757	from the sides all over that which in our language is called the
758	belly like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the
759	centre which he fastened in a knot the same which is called the
760	navel he also moulded the breast and took out most of the
761	wrinkles much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last he
762	left a few however in the region of the belly and navel as a
763	memorial of the primeval state After the division the two parts of
764	man each desiring his other half came together and throwing their
765	arms about one another entwined in mutual embraces longing to grow
766	into one they were on the point of dying from hunger and
767	self neglect because they did not like to do anything apart and when
768	one of the halves died and the other survived the survivor sought
769	another mate man or woman as we call them being the sections of
770	entire men or women and clung to that They were being destroyed 
771	when Zeus in pity of them invented a new plan he turned the parts
772	of generation round to the front for this had not been always their
773	position and they sowed the seed no longer as hitherto like
774	grasshoppers in the ground but in one another and after the
775	transposition the male generated in the female in order that by the
776	mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed and the race
777	might continue or if man came to man they might be satisfied and
778	rest and go their ways to the business of life so ancient is the
779	desire of one another which is implanted in us reuniting our original
780	nature making one of two and healing the state of man 
782	 Each of us when separated having one side only like a flat fish 
783	is but the indenture of a man and he is always looking for his
784	other half Men who are a section of that double nature which was once
785	called Androgynous are lovers of women adulterers are generally of
786	this breed and also adulterous women who lust after men the women
787	who are a section of the woman do not care for men but have female
788	attachments the female companions are of this sort But they who
789	are a section of the male follow the male and while they are young 
790	being slices of the original man they hang about men and embrace
791	them and they are themselves the best of boys and youths because
792	they have the most manly nature Some indeed assert that they are
793	shameless but this is not true for they do not act thus from any
794	want of shame but because they are valiant and manly and have a
795	manly countenance and they embrace that which is like them And these
796	when they grow up become our statesmen and these only which is a
797	great proof of the truth of what I am saving When they reach
798	manhood they are loves of youth and are not naturally inclined to
799	marry or beget children if at all they do so only in obedience to
800	the law but they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with
801	one another unwedded and such a nature is prone to love and ready
802	to return love always embracing that which is akin to him And when
803	one of them meets with his other half the actual half of himself 
804	whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort the pair
805	are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and
806	would not be out of the other s sight as I may say even for a
807	moment these are the people who pass their whole lives together 
808	yet they could not explain what they desire of one another For the
809	intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not
810	appear to be the desire of lover s intercourse but of something
811	else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell and
812	of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment Suppose
813	Hephaestus with his instruments to come to the pair who are lying
814	side by side and to say to them What do you people want of one
815	another they would be unable to explain And suppose further that
816	when he saw their perplexity he said Do you desire to be wholly one 
817	always day and night to be in one another s company for if this is
818	what you desire I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow
819	together so that being two you shall become one and while you live a
820	common life as if you were a single man and after your death in the
821	world below still be one departed soul instead of two I ask whether
822	this is what you lovingly desire and whether you are satisfied to
823	attain this there is not a man of them who when he heard the
824	proposal would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and
825	melting into one another this becoming one instead of two was the
826	very expression of his ancient need And the reason is that human
827	nature was originally one and we were a whole and the desire and
828	pursuit of the whole is called love There was a time I say when
829	we were one but now because of the wickedness of mankind God has
830	dispersed us as the Arcadians were dispersed into villages by the
831	Lacedaemonians And if we are not obedient to the gods there is a
832	danger that we shall be split up again and go about in
833	basso relievo like the profile figures having only half a nose
834	which are sculptured on monuments and that we shall be like tallies 
836	 Wherefore let us exhort all men to piety that we may avoid evil 
837	and obtain the good of which Love is to us the lord and minister and
838	let no one oppose him he is the enemy of the gods who oppose him 
839	For if we are friends of the God and at peace with him we shall find
840	our own true loves which rarely happens in this world at present I
841	am serious and therefore I must beg Eryximachus not to make fun or to
842	find any allusion in what I am saying to Pausanias and Agathon who 
843	as I suspect are both of the manly nature and belong to the class
844	which I have been describing But my words have a wider
845	application they include men and women everywhere and I believe
846	that if our loves were perfectly accomplished and each one
847	returning to his primeval nature had his original true love then
848	our race would be happy And if this would be best of all the best in
849	the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest
850	approach to such an union and that will be the attainment of a
851	congenial love Wherefore if we would praise him who has given to
852	us the benefit we must praise the god Love who is our greatest
853	benefactor both leading us in this life back to our own nature and
854	giving us high hopes for the future for he promises that if we are
855	pious he will restore us to our original state and heal us and
856	make us happy and blessed This Eryximachus is my discourse of love 
857	which although different to yours I must beg you to leave unassailed
858	by the shafts of your ridicule in order that each may have his
859	turn each or rather either for Agathon and Socrates are the only
860	ones left 
862	 Indeed I am not going to attack you said Eryximachus for I
863	thought your speech charming and did I not know that Agathon and
864	Socrates are masters in the art of love I should be really afraid
865	that they would have nothing to say after the world of things which
866	have been said already But for all that I am not without hopes 
868	 Socrates said You played your part well Eryximachus but if you
869	were as I am now or rather as I shall be when Agathon has spoken you
870	would indeed be in a great strait 
872	 You want to cast a spell over me Socrates said Agathon in the
873	hope that I may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the
874	audience that I shall speak well 
876	 I should be strangely forgetful Agathon replied Socrates of the
877	courage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions
878	were about to be exhibited and you came upon the stage with the
879	actors and faced the vast theatre altogether undismayed if I
880	thought that your nerves could be fluttered at a small party of
881	friends 
883	 Do you think Socrates said Agathon that my head is so full of the
884	theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a
885	few good judges are than many fools 
887	 Nay replied Socrates I should be very wrong in attributing to you 
888	Agathon that or any other want of refinement And I am quite aware
889	that if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise you would
890	care for their opinion much more than for that of the many But then
891	we having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre cannot be
892	regarded as the select wise though I know that if you chanced to be
893	in the presence not of one of ourselves but of some really wise man 
894	you would be ashamed of disgracing yourself before him would you not 
896	 Yes said Agathon 
898	 But before the many you would not be ashamed if you thought that
899	you were doing something disgraceful in their presence 
901	 Here Phaedrus interrupted them saying not answer him my dear
902	Agathon for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk 
903	especially a good looking one he will no longer care about the
904	completion of our plan Now I love to hear him talk but just at
905	present I must not forget the encomium on Love which I ought to
906	receive from him and from every one When you and he have paid your
907	tribute to the god then you may talk 
909	 Very good Phaedrus said Agathon I see no reason why I should
910	not proceed with my speech as I shall have many other opportunities
911	of conversing with Socrates Let me say first how I ought to speak 
912	and then speak 
914	 The previous speakers instead of praising the god Love or
915	unfolding his nature appear to have congratulated mankind on the
916	benefits which he confers upon them But I would rather praise the god
917	first and then speak of his gifts this is always the right way of
918	praising everything May I say without impiety or offence that of all
919	the blessed gods he is the most blessed because he is the fairest
920	and best And he is the fairest for in the first place he is the
921	youngest and of his youth he is himself the witness fleeing out of
922	the way of age who is swift enough swifter truly than most of us
923	like Love hates him and will not come near him but youth and love
924	live and move together like to like as the proverb says Many
925	things were said by Phaedrus about Love in which I agree with him but
926	I cannot agree that he is older than Iapetus and Kronos not so I
927	maintain him to be the youngest of the gods and youthful ever The
928	ancient doings among the gods of which Hesiod and Parmenides spoke if
929	the tradition of them be true were done of Necessity and not Love 
930	had Love been in those days there would have been no chaining or
931	mutilation of the gods or other violence but peace and sweetness as
932	there is now in heaven since the rule of Love began 
934	 Love is young and also tender he ought to have a poet like Homer to
935	describe his tenderness as Homer says of Ate that she is a goddess
936	and tender 
938	 Her feet are tender for she sets her steps 
940	 Not on the ground but on the heads of men 
942	herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness that she walks not
943	upon the hard but upon the soft Let us adduce a similar proof of
944	the tenderness of Love for he walks not upon the earth nor yet
945	upon skulls of men which are not so very soft but in the hearts
946	and souls of both god and men which are of all things the softest 
947	in them he walks and dwells and makes his home Not in every soul
948	without exception for Where there is hardness he departs where there
949	is softness there he dwells and nestling always with his feet and
950	in all manner of ways in the softest of soft places how can he be
951	other than the softest of all things Of a truth he is the tenderest
952	as well as the youngest and also he is of flexile form for if he
953	were hard and without flexure he could not enfold all things or
954	wind his way into and out of every soul of man undiscovered And a
955	proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his grace which is
956	universally admitted to be in an especial manner the attribute of
957	Love ungrace and love are always at war with one another The
958	fairness of his complexion is revealed by his habitation among the
959	flowers for he dwells not amid bloomless or fading beauties 
960	whether of body or soul or aught else but in the place of flowers and
961	scents there he sits and abides Concerning the beauty of the god I
962	have said enough and yet there remains much more which I might say 
963	Of his virtue I have now to speak his greatest glory is that he can
964	neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man for he
965	suffers not by force if he suffers force comes not near him 
966	neither when he acts does he act by force For all men in all things
967	serve him of their own free will and where there is voluntary
968	agreement there as the laws which are the lords of the city say 
969	is justice And not only is he just but exceedingly temperate for
970	Temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires and
971	no pleasure ever masters Love he is their master and they are his
972	servants and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed As to
973	courage even the God of War is no match for him he is the captive
974	and Love is the lord for love the love of Aphrodite masters him as
975	the tale runs and the master is stronger than the servant And if
976	he conquers the bravest of all others he must be himself the bravest 
978	 Of his courage and justice and temperance I have spoken but I
979	have yet to speak of his wisdom and according to the measure of my
980	ability I must try to do my best In the first place he is a poet and
981	here like Eryximachus I magnify my art and he is also the source
982	of poesy in others which he could not be if he were not himself a
983	poet And at the touch of him every one becomes a poet even though he
984	had no music in him before this also is a proof that Love is a good
985	poet and accomplished in all the fine arts for no one can give to
986	another that which he has not himself or teach that of which he has
987	no knowledge Who will deny that the creation of the animals is his
988	doing Are they not all the works his wisdom born and begotten of
989	him And as to the artists do we not know that he only of them whom
990	love inspires has the light of fame he whom Love touches riot walks
991	in darkness The arts of medicine and archery and divination were
992	discovered by Apollo under the guidance of love and desire so that
993	he too is a disciple of Love Also the melody of the Muses the
994	metallurgy of Hephaestus the weaving of Athene the empire of Zeus
995	over gods and men are all due to Love who was the inventor of
996	them And so Love set in order the empire of the gods the love of
997	beauty as is evident for with deformity Love has no concern In
998	the days of old as I began by saying dreadful deeds were done
999	among the gods for they were ruled by Necessity but now since the
1000	birth of Love and from the Love of the beautiful has sprung every
1001	good in heaven and earth Therefore Phaedrus I say of Love that he
1002	is the fairest and best in himself and the cause of what is fairest
1003	and best in all other things And there comes into my mind a line of
1004	poetry in which he is said to be the god who
1006	 Gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep 
1008	 Who stills the winds and bids the sufferer sleep 
1010	This is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with
1011	affection who makes them to meet together at banquets such as
1012	these in sacrifices feasts dances he is our lord who sends
1013	courtesy and sends away discourtesy who gives kindness ever and never
1014	gives unkindness the friend of the good the wonder of the wise 
1015	the amazement of the gods desired by those who have no part in him 
1016	and precious to those who have the better part in him parent of
1017	delicacy luxury desire fondness softness grace regardful of
1018	the good regardless of the evil in every word work wish 
1019	fear saviour pilot comrade helper glory of gods and men leader
1020	best and brightest in whose footsteps let every man follow sweetly
1021	singing in his honour and joining in that sweet strain with which love
1022	charms the souls of gods and men Such is the speech Phaedrus 
1023	half playful yet having a certain measure of seriousness which 
1024	according to my ability I dedicate to the god 
1026	 When Agathon had done speaking Aristodemus said that there was a
1027	general cheer the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner
1028	worthy of himself and of the god And Socrates looking at
1029	Eryximachus said Tell me son of Acumenus was there not reason in
1030	my fears and was I not a true prophet when I said that Agathon
1031	would make a wonderful oration and that I should be in a strait 
1033	 The part of the prophecy which concerns Agathon replied
1034	Eryximachus appears to me to be true but not the other part that
1035	you will be in a strait 
1037	 Why my dear friend said Socrates must not I or any one be in a
1038	strait who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied
1039	discourse I am especially struck with the beauty of the concluding
1040	words who could listen to them without amazement When I reflected
1041	on the immeasurable inferiority of my own powers I was ready to run
1042	away for shame if there had been a possibility of escape For I was
1043	reminded of Gorgias and at the end of his speech I fancied that
1044	Agathon was shaking at me the Gorginian or Gorgonian head of the great
1045	master of rhetoric which was simply to turn me and my speech into
1046	stone as Homer says and strike me dumb And then I perceived how
1047	foolish I had been in consenting to take my turn with you in
1048	praising love and saying that I too was a master of the art when I
1049	really had no conception how anything ought to be praised For in my
1050	simplicity I imagined that the topics of praise should be true and
1051	that this being presupposed out of the true the speaker was to choose
1052	the best and set them forth in the best manner And I felt quite
1053	proud thinking that I knew the nature of true praise and should
1054	speak well Whereas I now see that the intention was to attribute to
1055	Love every species of greatness and glory whether really belonging to
1056	him not without regard to truth or falsehood that was no matter 
1057	for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you
1058	should really praise Love but only that you should appear to praise
1059	him And so you attribute to Love every imaginable form of praise
1060	which can be gathered anywhere and you say that he is all this and
1061	 the cause of all that making him appear the fairest and best of all
1062	to those who know him not for you cannot impose upon those who know
1063	him And a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed But
1064	as I misunderstood the nature of the praise when I said that I would
1065	take my turn I must beg to be absolved from the promise which I
1066	made in ignorance and which as Euripides would say was a promise of
1067	the lips and not of the mind Farewell then to such a strain for I do
1068	not praise in that way no indeed I cannot But if you like to
1069	here the truth about love I am ready to speak in my own manner 
1070	though I will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any
1071	rivalry with you Say then Phaedrus whether you would like to
1072	have the truth about love spoken in any words and in any order
1073	which may happen to come into my mind at the time Will that be
1074	agreeable to you 
1076	 Aristodemus said that Phaedrus and the company bid him speak in
1077	any manner which he thought best Then he added let me have your
1078	permission first to ask Agathon a few more questions in order that
1079	I may take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse 
1081	 I grant the permission said Phaedrus put your questions 
1082	Socrates then proceeded as follows 
1084	 In the magnificent oration which you have just uttered I think that
1085	you were right my dear Agathon in proposing to speak of the nature
1086	of Love first and afterwards of his works that is a way of beginning
1087	which I very much approve And as you have spoken so eloquently of his
1088	nature may I ask you further Whether love is the love of something
1089	or of nothing And here I must explain myself I do not want you to
1090	say that love is the love of a father or the love of a mother that
1091	would be ridiculous but to answer as you would if I asked is a
1092	father a father of something to which you would find no difficulty in
1093	replying of a son or daughter and the answer would be right 
1095	 Very true said Agathon 
1097	 And you would say the same of a mother 
1099	 He assented 
1101	 Yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my
1102	meaning Is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of
1103	something 
1105	 Certainly he replied 
1107	 That is of a brother or sister 
1109	 Yes he said 
1111	 And now said Socrates I will ask about Love Is Love of
1112	something or of nothing 
1114	 Of something surely he replied 
1116	 Keep in mind what this is and tell me what I want to know whether
1117	Love desires that of which love is 
1119	 Yes surely 
1121	 And does he possess or does he not possess that which he loves and
1122	desires 
1124	 Probably not I should say 
1126	 Nay replied Socrates I would have you consider whether
1127	 necessarily is not rather the word The inference that he who
1128	desires something is in want of something and that he who desires
1129	nothing is in want of nothing is in my judgment Agathon absolutely
1130	and necessarily true What do you think 
1132	 I agree with you said Agathon 
1134	 Very good Would he who is great desire to be great or he who is
1135	strong desire to be strong 
1137	 That would be inconsistent with our previous admissions 
1139	 True For he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is 
1141	 Very true 
1143	 And yet added Socrates if a man being strong desired to be strong 
1144	or being swift desired to be swift or being healthy desired to be
1145	healthy in that case he might be thought to desire something which he
1146	already has or is I give the example in order that we may avoid
1147	misconception For the possessors of these qualities Agathon must be
1148	supposed to have their respective advantages at the time whether they
1149	choose or not and who can desire that which he has Therefore when
1150	a person says I am well and wish to be well or I am rich and wish to
1151	be rich and I desire simply to have what I have to him we shall
1152	reply You my friend having wealth and health and strength want to
1153	have the continuance of them for at this moment whether you choose
1154	or no you have them And when you say I desire that which I have and
1155	nothing else is not your meaning that you want to have what you now
1156	have in the future He must agree with us must he not 
1158	 He must replied Agathon 
1160	 Then said Socrates he desires that what he has at present may be
1161	preserved to him in the future which is equivalent to saying that
1162	he desires something which is non existent to him and which as yet he
1163	has not got 
1165	 Very true he said 
1167	 Then he and every one who desires desires that which he has not
1168	already and which is future and not present and which he has not 
1169	and is not and of which he is in want these are the sort of things
1170	which love and desire seek 
1172	 Very true he said 
1174	 Then now said Socrates let us recapitulate the argument First is
1175	not love of something and of something too which is wanting to a man 
1177	 Yes he replied 
1179	 Remember further what you said in your speech or if you do not
1180	remember I will remind you you said that the love of the beautiful
1181	set in order the empire of the gods for that of deformed things there
1182	is no love did you not say something of that kind 
1184	 Yes said Agathon 
1186	 Yes my friend and the remark was a just one And if this is
1187	true Love is the love of beauty and not of deformity 
1189	 He assented 
1191	 And the admission has been already made that Love is of something
1192	which a man wants and has not 
1194	 True he said 
1196	 Then Love wants and has not beauty 
1198	 Certainly he replied 
1200	 And would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess
1201	beauty 
1203	 Certainly not 
1205	 Then would you still say that love is beautiful 
1207	 Agathon replied I fear that I did not understand what I was saying 
1209	 You made a very good speech Agathon replied Socrates but there is
1210	yet one small question which I would fain ask Is not the good also
1211	the beautiful 
1213	 Yes 
1215	 Then in wanting the beautiful love wants also the good 
1217	 I cannot refute you Socrates said Agathon Let us assume that what
1218	you say is true 
1220	 Say rather beloved Agathon that you cannot refute the truth for
1221	Socrates is easily refuted 
1223	 And now taking my leave of you I would rehearse a tale of love
1224	which I heard from Diotima of Mantineia a woman wise in this and in
1225	many other kinds of knowledge who in the days of old when the
1226	Athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague delayed
1227	the disease ten years She was my instructress in the art of love and
1228	I shall repeat to you what she said to me beginning with the
1229	admissions made by Agathon which are nearly if not quite the same
1230	which I made to the wise woman when she questioned me I think that
1231	this will be the easiest way and I shall take both parts myself as
1232	well as I can As you Agathon suggested I must speak first of the
1233	being and nature of Love and then of his works First I said to her
1234	in nearly the same words which he used to me that Love was a mighty
1235	god and likewise fair and she proved to me as I proved to him that 
1236	by my own showing Love was neither fair nor good What do you
1237	mean Diotima I said is love then evil and foul Hush she
1238	cried must that be foul which is not fair Certainly I said 
1239	 And is that which is not wise ignorant do you not see that there is
1240	a mean between wisdom and ignorance And what may that be I
1241	said Right opinion she replied which as you know being
1242	incapable of giving a reason is not knowledge for how can
1243	knowledge be devoid of reason nor again ignorance for neither can
1244	ignorance attain the truth but is clearly something which is a
1245	mean between ignorance and wisdom Quite true I replied Do not
1246	then insist she said that what is not fair is of necessity foul 
1247	or what is not good evil or infer that because love is not fair and
1248	good he is therefore foul and evil for he is in a mean between them 
1249	 Well I said Love is surely admitted by all to be a great god 
1250	 By those who know or by those who do not know By all And how 
1251	Socrates she said with a smile can Love be acknowledged to be a
1252	great god by those who say that he is not a god at all And who
1253	are they I said You and I are two of them she replied How
1254	can that be I said It is quite intelligible she replied for
1255	you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair of
1256	course you would would to say that any god was not Certainly
1257	not I replied And you mean by the happy those who are the
1258	possessors of things good or fair Yes And you admitted that
1259	Love because he was in want desires those good and fair things of
1260	which he is in want Yes I did But how can he be a god who has
1261	no portion in what is either good or fair Impossible Then you
1262	see that you also deny the divinity of Love 
1264	 What then is Love I asked Is he mortal No What then As
1265	in the former instance he is neither mortal nor immortal but in a
1266	mean between the two What is he Diotima He is a great spirit
1267	 daimon and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine
1268	and the mortal And what I said is his power He
1269	interprets she replied between gods and men conveying and
1270	taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men and to
1271	men the commands and replies of the gods he is the mediator who spans
1272	the chasm which divides them and therefore in him all is bound
1273	together and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest 
1274	their sacrifices and mysteries and charms and all prophecy and
1275	incantation find their way For God mingles not with man but through
1276	Love all the intercourse and converse of god with man whether awake
1277	or asleep is carried on The wisdom which understands this is
1278	spiritual all other wisdom such as that of arts and handicrafts 
1279	is mean and vulgar Now these spirits or intermediate powers are
1280	many and diverse and one of them is Love And who I said was his
1281	father and who his mother The tale she said will take time 
1282	nevertheless I will tell you On the birthday of Aphrodite there was a
1283	feast of the gods at which the god Poros or Plenty who is the son of
1284	Metis or Discretion was one of the guests When the feast was over 
1285	Penia or Poverty as the manner is on such occasions came about the
1286	doors to beg Now Plenty who was the worse for nectar there was no
1287	wine in those days went into the garden of Zeus and fell into a
1288	heavy sleep and Poverty considering her own straitened circumstances 
1289	plotted to have a child by him and accordingly she lay down at his
1290	side and conceived love who partly because he is naturally a lover of
1291	the beautiful and because Aphrodite is herself beautiful and also
1292	because he was born on her birthday is her follower and attendant 
1293	And as his parentage is so also are his fortunes In the first
1294	place he is always poor and anything but tender and fair as the many
1295	imagine him and he is rough and squalid and has no shoes nor a
1296	house to dwell in on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open
1297	heaven in the streets or at the doors of houses taking his rest 
1298	and like his mother he is always in distress Like his father too 
1299	whom he also partly resembles he is always plotting against the
1300	fair and good he is bold enterprising strong a mighty hunter 
1301	always weaving some intrigue or other keen in the pursuit of
1302	wisdom fertile in resources a philosopher at all times terrible
1303	as an enchanter sorcerer sophist He is by nature neither mortal nor
1304	immortal but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in
1305	plenty and dead at another moment and again alive by reason of his
1306	father s nature But that which is always flowing in is always flowing
1307	out and so he is never in want and never in wealth and further 
1308	he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge The truth of the
1309	matter is this No god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom for
1310	he is wise already nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom 
1311	Neither do the ignorant seek after Wisdom For herein is the evil of
1312	ignorance that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless
1313	satisfied with himself he has no desire for that of which he feels no
1314	want But who then Diotima I said are the lovers of wisdom 
1315	if they are neither the wise nor the foolish A child may answer
1316	that question she replied they are those who are in a mean between
1317	the two Love is one of them For wisdom is a most beautiful thing 
1318	and Love is of the beautiful and therefore Love is also a
1319	philosopher or lover of wisdom and being a lover of wisdom is in a
1320	mean between the wise and the ignorant And of this too his birth is
1321	the cause for his father is wealthy and wise and his mother poor and
1322	foolish Such my dear Socrates is the nature of the spirit Love The
1323	error in your conception of him was very natural and as I imagine
1324	from what you say has arisen out of a confusion of love and the
1325	beloved which made you think that love was all beautiful For the
1326	beloved is the truly beautiful and delicate and perfect and
1327	blessed but the principle of love is of another nature and is such
1328	as I have described 
1330	 I said O thou stranger woman thou sayest well but assuming Love
1331	to be such as you say what is the use of him to men That 
1332	Socrates she replied I will attempt to unfold of his nature and
1333	birth I have already spoken and you acknowledge that love is of the
1334	beautiful But some one will say Of the beautiful in what Socrates
1335	and Diotima or rather let me put the question more dearly and ask 
1336	When a man loves the beautiful what does he desire I answered her
1337	 That the beautiful may be his Still she said the answer
1338	suggests a further question What is given by the possession of
1339	beauty To what you have asked I replied I have no answer
1340	ready Then she said Let me put the word good in the place
1341	of the beautiful and repeat the question once more If he who loves
1342	good what is it then that he loves The possession of the good I
1343	said And what does he gain who possesses the good Happiness I
1344	replied there is less difficulty in answering that question Yes 
1345	she said the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things 
1346	Nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness the answer
1347	is already final You are right I said And is this wish and this
1348	desire common to all and do all men always desire their own good 
1349	or only some men what say you All men I replied the desire
1350	is common to all Why then she rejoined are not all men 
1351	Socrates said to love but only some them whereas you say that all
1352	men are always loving the same things I myself wonder I said why
1353	this is There is nothing to wonder at she replied the reason is
1354	that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the
1355	whole but the other parts have other names Give an
1356	illustration I said She answered me as follows There is poetry 
1357	which as you know is complex and manifold All creation or
1358	passage of non being into being is poetry or making and the processes
1359	of all art are creative and the masters of arts are all poets or
1360	makers Very true Still she said you know that they are not
1361	called poets but have other names only that portion of the art which
1362	is separated off from the rest and is concerned with music and metre 
1363	is termed poetry and they who possess poetry in this sense of the
1364	word are called poets Very true I said And the same holds of
1365	love For you may say generally that all desire of good and
1366	happiness is only the great and subtle power of love but they who are
1367	drawn towards him by any other path whether the path of
1368	money making or gymnastics or philosophy are not called lovers the
1369	name of the whole is appropriated to those whose affection takes one
1370	form only they alone are said to love or to be lovers I dare say 
1371	I replied that you are right Yes she added and you hear
1372	people say that lovers are seeking for their other half but I say
1373	that they are seeking neither for the half of themselves nor for
1374	the whole unless the half or the whole be also a good And they
1375	will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away if they
1376	are evil for they love not what is their own unless perchance
1377	there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good and what
1378	belongs to another the evil For there is nothing which men love but
1379	the good Is there anything Certainly I should say that there
1380	is nothing Then she said the simple truth is that men love the
1381	good Yes I said To which must be added that they love the
1382	possession of the good Yes that must be added And not only the
1383	possession but the everlasting possession of the good That must be
1384	added too Then love she said may be described generally as
1385	the love of the everlasting possession of the good That is most
1386	true 
1388	 Then if this be the nature of love can you tell me further she
1389	said what is the manner of the pursuit what are they doing who show
1390	all this eagerness and heat which is called love and what is the
1391	object which they have in view Answer me Nay Diotima I replied 
1392	 if I had known I should not have wondered at your wisdom neither
1393	should I have come to learn from you about this very matter 
1394	 Well she said I will teach you The object which they have in
1395	view is birth in beauty whether of body or soul I do not
1396	understand you I said the oracle requires an explanation I will
1397	make my meaning dearer she replied I mean to say that all men are
1398	bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls There is a
1399	certain age at which human nature is desirous of
1400	procreation procreation which must be in beauty and not in
1401	deformity and this procreation is the union of man and woman and
1402	is a divine thing for conception and generation are an immortal
1403	principle in the mortal creature and in the inharmonious they can
1404	never be But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine and
1405	the beautiful harmonious Beauty then is the destiny or goddess of
1406	parturition who presides at birth and therefore when approaching
1407	beauty the conceiving power is propitious and diffusive and benign 
1408	and begets and bears fruit at the sight of ugliness she frowns and
1409	contracts and has a sense of pain and turns away and shrivels up 
1410	and not without a pang refrains from conception And this is the
1411	reason why when the hour of conception arrives and the teeming
1412	nature is full there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose
1413	approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail For love 
1414	Socrates is not as you imagine the love of the beautiful only 
1415	 What then The love of generation and of birth in beauty Yes I
1416	said Yes indeed she replied But why of generation Because to
1417	the mortal creature generation is a sort of eternity and
1418	immortality she replied and if as has been already admitted love
1419	is of the everlasting possession of the good all men will necessarily
1420	desire immortality together with good Wherefore love is of
1421	immortality 
1423	 All this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love 
1424	And I remember her once saying to me What is the cause Socrates of
1425	love and the attendant desire See you not how all animals birds as
1426	well as beasts in their desire of procreation are in agony when they
1427	take the infection of love which begins with the desire of union 
1428	whereto is added the care of offspring on whose behalf the weakest
1429	are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost and
1430	to die for them and will let themselves be tormented with hunger
1431	or suffer anything in order to maintain their young Man may be
1432	supposed to act thus from reason but why should animals have these
1433	passionate feelings Can you tell me why Again I replied that I
1434	did not know She said to me And do you expect ever to become a
1435	master in the art of love if you do not know this But I have
1436	told you already Diotima that my ignorance is the reason why I
1437	come to you for I am conscious that I want a teacher tell me then
1438	the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love Marvel not 
1439	she said if you believe that love is of the immortal as we have
1440	several times acknowledged for here again and on the same
1441	principle too the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to
1442	be everlasting and immortal and this is only to be attained by
1443	generation because generation always leaves behind a new existence in
1444	the place of the old Nay even in the life of the same individual
1445	there is succession and not absolute unity a man is called the
1446	same and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and
1447	age and in which every animal is said to have life and identity he
1448	is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparation hair 
1449	flesh bones blood and the whole body are always changing Which
1450	is true not only of the body but also of the soul whose habits 
1451	tempers opinions desires pleasures pains fears never remain
1452	the same in any one of us but are always coming and going and
1453	equally true of knowledge and what is still more surprising to us
1454	mortals not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay so
1455	that in respect of them we are never the same but each of them
1456	individually experiences a like change For what is implied in the
1457	word recollection but the departure of knowledge which is ever
1458	being forgotten and is renewed and preserved by recollection and
1459	appears to be the same although in reality new according to that
1460	law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved not
1461	absolutely the same but by substitution the old worn out mortality
1462	leaving another new and similar existence behind unlike the divine 
1463	which is always the same and not another And in this way Socrates 
1464	the mortal body or mortal anything partakes of immortality but
1465	the immortal in another way Marvel not then at the love which all men
1466	have of their offspring for that universal love and interest is for
1467	the sake of immortality 
1469	 I was astonished at her words and said Is this really true O
1470	thou wise Diotima And she answered with all the authority of an
1471	accomplished sophist Of that Socrates you may be assured think
1472	only of the ambition of men and you will wonder at the
1473	senselessness of their ways unless you consider how they are
1474	stirred by the love of an immortality of fame They are ready to run
1475	all risks greater far than they would have for their children and
1476	to spend money and undergo any sort of toil and even to die for
1477	the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal Do
1478	you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus or Achilles
1479	to avenge Patroclus or your own Codrus in order to preserve the
1480	kingdom for his sons if they had not imagined that the memory of
1481	their virtues which still survives among us would be immortal Nay 
1482	she said I am persuaded that all men do all things and the better
1483	they are the more they do them in hope of the glorious fame of
1484	immortal virtue for they desire the immortal 
1486	 Those who are pregnant in the body only betake themselves to women
1487	and beget children this is the character of their love their
1488	offspring as they hope will preserve their memory and giving them
1489	the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future But
1490	souls which are pregnant for there certainly are men who are more
1491	creative in their souls than in their bodies conceive that which is
1492	proper for the soul to conceive or contain And what are these
1493	conceptions wisdom and virtue in general And such creators are poets
1494	and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor But the
1495	greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is
1496	concerned with the ordering of states and families and which is
1497	called temperance and justice And he who in youth has the seed of
1498	these implanted in him and is himself inspired when he comes to
1499	maturity desires to beget and generate He wanders about seeking
1500	beauty that he may beget offspring for in deformity he will beget
1501	nothing and naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the
1502	deformed body above all when he finds fair and noble and
1503	well nurtured soul he embraces the two in one person and to such
1504	an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits
1505	of a good man and he tries to educate him and at the touch of the
1506	beautiful which is ever present to his memory even when absent he
1507	brings forth that which he had conceived long before and in company
1508	with him tends that which he brings forth and they are married by a
1509	far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget
1510	mortal children for the children who are their common offspring are
1511	fairer and more immortal Who when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod
1512	and other great poets would not rather have their children than
1513	ordinary human ones Who would not emulate them in the creation of
1514	children such as theirs which have preserved their memory and given
1515	them everlasting glory Or who would not have such children as
1516	Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours not only of Lacedaemon 
1517	but of Hellas as one may say There is Solon too who is the revered
1518	father of Athenian laws and many others there are in many other
1519	places both among hellenes and barbarians who have given to the
1520	world many noble works and have been the parents of virtue of every
1521	kind and many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake
1522	of children such as theirs which were never raised in honour of any
1523	one for the sake of his mortal children 
1525	 These are the lesser mysteries of love into which even you 
1526	Socrates may enter to the greater and more hidden ones which are the
1527	crown of these and to which if you pursue them in a right spirit 
1528	they will lead I know not whether you will be able to attain But I
1529	will do my utmost to inform you and do you follow if you can For
1530	he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to
1531	visit beautiful forms and first if he be guided by his instructor
1532	aright to love one such form only out of that he should create fair
1533	thoughts and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of
1534	one form is akin to the beauty of another and then if beauty of
1535	form in general is his pursuit how foolish would he be not to
1536	recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same And when he
1537	perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one which he
1538	will despise and deem a small thing and will become a lover of all
1539	beautiful forms in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of
1540	the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form So
1541	that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness he will be
1542	content to love and tend him and will search out and bring to the
1543	birth thoughts which may improve the young until he is compelled to
1544	contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws and to
1545	understand that the beauty of them all is of one family and that
1546	personal beauty is a trifle and after laws and institutions he will
1547	go on to the sciences that he may see their beauty being not like
1548	a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or
1549	institution himself a slave mean and narrow minded but drawing
1550	towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty he will create
1551	many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of
1552	wisdom until on that shore he grows and waxes strong and at last the
1553	vision is revealed to him of a single science which is the science of
1554	beauty everywhere To this I will proceed please to give me your very
1555	best attention 
1557	 He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love and
1558	who has learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession when
1559	he comes toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous
1560	beauty and this Socrates is the final cause of all our former
1561	toils a nature which in the first place is everlasting not growing
1562	and decaying or waxing and waning secondly not fair in one point of
1563	view and foul in another or at one time or in one relation or at
1564	one place fair at another time or in another relation or at another
1565	place foul as if fair to some and foul to others or in the
1566	likeness of a face or hands or any other part of the bodily frame 
1567	or in any form of speech or knowledge or existing in any other being 
1568	as for example in an animal or in heaven or in earth or in any
1569	other place but beauty absolute separate simple and everlasting 
1570	which without diminution and without increase or any change is
1571	imparted to the ever growing and perishing beauties of all other
1572	things He who from these ascending under the influence of true
1573	love begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end And the
1574	true order of going or being led by another to the things of love 
1575	is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the
1576	sake of that other beauty using these as steps only and from one
1577	going on to two and from two to all fair forms and from fair forms
1578	to fair practices and from fair practices to fair notions until from
1579	fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty and at
1580	last knows what the essence of beauty is This my dear Socrates 
1581	said the stranger of Mantineia is that life above all others which
1582	man should live in the contemplation of beauty absolute a beauty
1583	which if you once beheld you would see not to be after the measure of
1584	gold and garments and fair boys and youths whose presence now
1585	entrances you and you and many a one would be content to live
1586	seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink if
1587	that were possible you only want to look at them and to be with
1588	them But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty the divine
1589	beauty I mean pure and dear and unalloyed not clogged with the
1590	pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human
1591	life thither looking and holding converse with the true beauty simple
1592	and divine Remember how in that communion only beholding beauty with
1593	the eye of the mind he will be enabled to bring forth not images
1594	of beauty but realities for he has hold not of an image but of a
1595	reality and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become
1596	the friend of God and be immortal if mortal man may Would that be an
1597	ignoble life 
1599	 Such Phaedrus and I speak not only to you but to all of you were
1600	the words of Diotima and I am persuaded of their truth And being
1601	persuaded of them I try to persuade others that in the attainment of
1602	this end human nature will not easily find a helper better than
1603	love And therefore also I say that every man ought to honour him as
1604	I myself honour him and walk in his ways and exhort others to do the
1605	same and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure
1606	of my ability now and ever 
1608	 The words which I have spoken you Phaedrus may call an encomium
1609	of love or anything else which you please 
1611	 When Socrates had done speaking the company applauded and
1612	Aristophanes was beginning to say something in answer to the
1613	allusion which Socrates had made to his own speech when suddenly
1614	there was a great knocking at the door of the house as of
1615	revellers and the sound of a flute girl was heard Agathon told the
1616	attendants to go and see who were the intruders If they are
1617	friends of ours he said invite them in but if not say that the
1618	drinking is over A little while afterwards they heard the voice of
1619	Alcibiades resounding in the court he was in a great state of
1620	intoxication and kept roaring and shouting Where is Agathon Lead
1621	me to Agathon and at length supported by the flute girl and some of
1622	his attendants he found his way to them Hail friends he said 
1623	appearing at the door crown with a massive garland of ivy and
1624	violets his head flowing with ribands Will you have a very
1625	drunken man as a companion of your revels Or shall I crown Agathon 
1626	which was my intention in coming and go away For I was unable to
1627	come yesterday and therefore I am here to day carrying on my head
1628	these ribands that taking them from my own head I may crown the head
1629	of this fairest and wisest of men as I may be allowed to call him 
1630	Will you laugh at me because I am drunk Yet I know very well that I
1631	am speaking the truth although you may laugh But first tell me if I
1632	come in shall we have the understanding of which I spoke Will you
1633	drink with me or not 
1635	 The company were vociferous in begging that he would take his
1636	place among them and Agathon specially invited him Thereupon he
1637	was led in by the people who were with him and as he was being led 
1638	intending to crown Agathon he took the ribands from his own head
1639	and held them in front of his eyes he was thus prevented from
1640	seeing Socrates who made way for him and Alcibiades took the
1641	vacant place between Agathon and Socrates and in taking the place
1642	he embraced Agathon and crowned him Take off his sandals said
1643	Agathon and let him make a third on the same couch 
1645	 By all means but who makes the third partner in our revels said
1646	Alcibiades turning round and starting up as he caught sight of
1647	Socrates By Heracles he said what is this here is Socrates
1648	always lying in wait for me and always as his way is coming out
1649	at all sorts of unsuspected places and now what have you to say
1650	for yourself and why are you lying here where I perceive that you
1651	have contrived to find a place not by a joker or lover of jokes like
1652	Aristophanes but by the fairest of the company 
1654	 Socrates turned to Agathon and said I must ask you to protect me 
1655	Agathon for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious
1656	matter to me Since I became his admirer I have never been allowed
1657	to speak to any other fair one or so much as to look at them If I
1658	do he goes wild with envy and jealousy and not only abuses me but
1659	can hardly keep his hands off me and at this moment he may do me some
1660	harm Please to see to this and either reconcile me to him or if he
1661	attempts violence protect me as I am in bodily fear of his mad and
1662	passionate attempts 
1664	 There can never be reconciliation between you and me said
1665	Alcibiades but for the present I will defer your chastisement And
1666	I must beg you Agathoron to give me back some of the ribands that
1667	I may crown the marvellous head of this universal despot I would not
1668	have him complain of me for crowning you and neglecting him who in
1669	conversation is the conqueror of all mankind and this not only
1670	once as you were the day before yesterday but always Whereupon 
1671	taking some of the ribands he crowned Socrates and again reclined 
1673	 Then he said You seem my friends to be sober which is a thing
1674	not to be endured you must drink for that was the agreement under
1675	which I was admitted and I elect myself master of the feast until
1676	you are well drunk Let us have a large goblet Agathon or rather he
1677	said addressing the attendant bring me that wine cooler The
1678	wine cooler which had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than
1679	two quarts this he filled and emptied and bade the attendant fill
1680	it again for Socrates Observe my friends said Alcibiades that this
1681	ingenious trick of mine will have no effect on Socrates for he can
1682	drink any quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk 
1683	Socrates drank the cup which the attendant filled for him 
1685	 Eryximachus said What is this Alcibiades Are we to have neither
1686	conversation nor singing over our cups but simply to drink as if we
1687	were thirsty 
1689	 Alcibiades replied Hail worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire 
1691	 The same to you said Eryximachus but what shall we do 
1693	 That I leave to you said Alcibiades 
1695	 The wise physician skilled our wounds to heal
1697	shall prescribe and we will obey What do you want 
1699	 Well said Eryximachus before you appeared we had passed a
1700	resolution that each one of us in turn should make a speech in
1701	praise of love and as good a one as he could the turn was passed
1702	round from left to right and as all of us have spoken and you have
1703	not spoken but have well drunken you ought to speak and then
1704	impose upon Socrates any task which you please and he on his right
1705	hand neighbour and so on 
1707	 That is good Eryximachus said Alcibiades and yet the
1708	comparison of a drunken man s speech with those of sober men is
1709	hardly fair and I should like to know sweet friend whether you
1710	really believe what Socrates was just now saying for I can assure you
1711	that the very reverse is the fact and that if I praise any one but
1712	himself in his presence whether God or man he will hardly keep his
1713	hands off me 
1715	 For shame said Socrates 
1717	 Hold your tongue said Alcibiades for by Poseidon there is no
1718	one else whom I will praise when you are of the company 
1720	 Well then said Eryximachus if you like praise Socrates 
1722	 What do you think Eryximachus said Alcibiades shall I attack
1723	him and inflict the punishment before you all 
1725	 What are you about said Socrates are you going to raise a laugh at
1726	my expense Is that the meaning of your praise 
1728	 I am going to speak the truth if you will permit me 
1730	 I not only permit but exhort you to speak the truth 
1732	 Then I will begin at once said Alcibiades and if I say anything
1733	which is not true you may interrupt me if you will and say that
1734	is a lie though my intention is to speak the truth But you must not
1735	wonder if I speak any how as things come into my mind for the
1736	fluent and orderly enumeration of all your singularities is not a task
1737	which is easy to a man in my condition 
1739	 And now my boys I shall praise Socrates in a figure which will
1740	appear to him to be a caricature and yet I speak not to make fun
1741	of him but only for the truth s sake I say that he is exactly
1742	like the busts of Silenus which are set up in the statuaries 
1743	shops holding pipes and flutes in their mouths and they are made
1744	to open in the middle and have images of gods inside them I say also
1745	that hit is like Marsyas the satyr You yourself will not deny 
1746	Socrates that your face is like that of a satyr Aye and there is
1747	a resemblance in other points too For example you are a bully as
1748	I can prove by witnesses if you will not confess And are you not a
1749	flute player That you are and a performer far more wonderful than
1750	Marsyas He indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men
1751	by the powers of his breath and the players of his music do so still 
1752	for the melodies of Olympus are derived from Marsyas who taught
1753	them and these whether they are played by a great master or by a
1754	miserable flute girl have a power which no others have they alone
1755	possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods
1756	and mysteries because they are divine But you produce the same
1757	effect with your words only and do not require the flute that is the
1758	difference between you and him When we hear any other speaker even
1759	very good one he produces absolutely no effect upon us or not
1760	much whereas the mere fragments of you and your words even at
1761	second hand and however imperfectly repeated amaze and possess the
1762	souls of every man woman and child who comes within hearing of them 
1763	And if I were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk 
1764	I would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they
1765	have always had and still have over me For my heart leaps within me
1766	more than that of any Corybantian reveller and my eyes rain tears
1767	when I hear them And I observe that many others are affected in the
1768	same manner I have heard Pericles and other great orators and I
1769	thought that they spoke well but I never had any similar feeling 
1770	my soul was not stirred by them nor was I angry at the thought of
1771	my own slavish state But this Marsyas has often brought me to such
1772	pass that I have felt as if I could hardly endure the life which I am
1773	leading this Socrates you will admit and I am conscious that if I
1774	did not shut my ears against him and fly as from the voice of the
1775	siren my fate would be like that of others he would transfix me and
1776	I should grow old sitting at his feet For he makes me confess that
1777	I ought not to live as I do neglecting the wants of my own soul 
1778	and busying myself with the concerns of the Athenians therefore I
1779	hold my ears and tear myself away from him And he is the only
1780	person who ever made me ashamed which you might think not to be in my
1781	nature and there is no one else who does the same For I know that
1782	I cannot answer him or say that I ought not to do as he bids but when
1783	I leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of me And
1784	therefore I run away and fly from him and when I see him I am ashamed
1785	of what I have confessed to him Many a time have I wished that he
1786	were dead and yet I know that I should be much more sorry than
1787	glad if he were to die so that am at my wit s end 
1789	 And this is what I and many others have suffered from the
1790	flute playing of this satyr Yet hear me once more while I show you
1791	how exact the image is and how marvellous his power For let me tell
1792	you none of you know him but I will reveal him to you having begun 
1793	I must go on See you how fond he is of the fair He is always with
1794	them and is always being smitten by them and then again he knows
1795	nothing and is ignorant of all thing such is the appearance which he
1796	puts on Is he not like a Silenus in this To be sure he is his outer
1797	mask is the carved head of the Silenus but O my companions in drink 
1798	when he is opened what temperance there is residing within Know
1799	you that beauty and wealth and honour at which the many wonder are
1800	of no account with him and are utterly despised by him he regards
1801	not at all the persons who are gifted with them mankind are nothing
1802	to him all his life is spent in mocking and flouting at them But
1803	when I opened him and looked within at his serious purpose I saw
1804	in him divine and golden images of such fascinating beauty that I
1805	was ready to do in a moment whatever Socrates commanded they may have
1806	escaped the observation of others but I saw them Now I fancied
1807	that he was seriously enamoured of my beauty and I thought that I
1808	should therefore have a grand opportunity of hearing him tell what
1809	he knew for I had a wonderful opinion of the attractions of my youth 
1810	In the prosecution of this design when I next went to him I sent
1811	away the attendant who usually accompanied me I will confess the
1812	whole truth and beg you to listen and if I speak falsely do you 
1813	Socrates expose the falsehood Well he and I were alone together 
1814	and I thought that when there was nobody with us I should hear him
1815	speak the language which lovers use to their loves when they are by
1816	themselves and I was delighted Nothing of the sort he conversed
1817	as usual and spent the day with me and then went away Afterwards I
1818	challenged him to the palaestra and he wrestled and closed with me 
1819	several times when there was no one present I fancied that I might
1820	succeed in this manner Not a bit I made no way with him Lastly 
1821	as I had failed hitherto I thought that I must take stronger measures
1822	and attack him boldly and as I had begun not give him up but see
1823	how matters stood between him and me So I invited him to sup with me 
1824	just as if he were a fair youth and I a designing lover He was not
1825	easily persuaded to come he did however after a while accept the
1826	invitation and when he came the first time he wanted to go away at
1827	once as soon as supper was over and I had not the face to detain him 
1828	The second time still in pursuance of my design after we had supped 
1829	I went on conversing far into the night and when he wanted to go
1830	away I pretended that the hour was late and that he had much better
1831	remain So he lay down on the couch next to me the same on which he
1832	had supped and there was no one but ourselves sleeping in the
1833	apartment All this may be told without shame to any one But what
1834	follows I could hardly tell you if I were sober Yet as the proverb
1835	says In vino veritas whether with boys or without them and
1836	therefore I must speak Nor again should I be justified in
1837	concealing the lofty actions of Socrates when I come to praise him 
1838	Moreover I have felt the serpent s sting and he who has suffered 
1839	as they say is willing to tell his fellow sufferers only as they
1840	alone will be likely to understand him and will not be extreme in
1841	judging of the sayings or doings which have been wrung from his agony 
1842	For I have been bitten by a more than viper s tooth I have known in
1843	my soul or in my heart or in some other part that worst of pangs 
1844	more violent in ingenuous youth than any serpent s tooth the pang
1845	of philosophy which will make a man say or do anything And you
1846	whom I see around me Phaedrus and Agathon and Eryximachus and
1847	Pausanias and Aristodemus and Aristophanes all of you and I need not
1848	say Socrates himself have had experience of the same madness and
1849	passion in your longing after wisdom Therefore listen and excuse my
1850	doings then and my sayings now But let the attendants and other
1851	profane and unmannered persons close up the doors of their ears 
1853	 When the lamp was put out and the servants had gone away I
1854	thought that I must be plain with him and have no more ambiguity So I
1855	gave him a shake and I said Socrates are you asleep No he
1856	said Do you know what I am meditating What are you meditating he
1857	said I think I replied that of all the lovers whom I have ever
1858	had you are the only one who is worthy of me and you appear to be too
1859	modest to speak Now I feel that I should be a fool to refuse you this
1860	or any other favour and therefore I come to lay at your feet all that
1861	I have and all that my friends have in the hope that you will
1862	assist me in the way of virtue which I desire above all things and
1863	in which I believe that you can help me better than any one else 
1864	And I should certainly have more reason to be ashamed of what wise men
1865	would say if I were to refuse a favour to such as you than of what
1866	the world who are mostly fools would say of me if I granted it To
1867	these words he replied in the ironical manner which is so
1868	characteristic of him Alcibiades my friend you have indeed an
1869	elevated aim if what you say is true and if there really is in me any
1870	power by which you may become better truly you must see in me some
1871	rare beauty of a kind infinitely higher than any which I see in you 
1872	And therefore if you mean to share with me and to exchange beauty for
1873	beauty you will have greatly the advantage of me you will gain
1874	true beauty in return for appearance like Diomede gold in exchange
1875	for brass But look again sweet friend and see whether you are not
1876	deceived in me The mind begins to grow critical when the bodily eye
1877	fails and it will be a long time before you get old Hearing this I
1878	said I have told you my purpose which is quite serious and do
1879	you consider what you think best for you and me That is good he
1880	said at some other time then we will consider and act as seems
1881	best about this and about other matters Whereupon I fancied that
1882	was smitten and that the words which I had uttered like arrows had
1883	wounded him and so without waiting to hear more I got up and
1884	throwing my coat about him crept under his threadbare cloak as the
1885	time of year was winter and there I lay during the whole night having
1886	this wonderful monster in my arms This again Socrates will not be
1887	denied by you And yet notwithstanding all he was so superior to
1888	my solicitations so contemptuous and derisive and disdainful of my
1889	beauty which really as I fancied had some attractions hear O
1890	judges for judges you shall be of the haughty virtue of
1891	Socrates nothing more happened but in the morning when I awoke let
1892	all the gods and goddesses be my witnesses I arose as from the
1893	couch of a father or an elder brother 
1895	 What do you suppose must have been my feelings after this
1896	rejection at the thought of my own dishonour And yet I could not
1897	help wondering at his natural temperance and self restraint and
1898	manliness I never imagined that I could have met with a man such as
1899	he is in wisdom and endurance And therefore I could not be angry with
1900	him or renounce his company any more than I could hope to win him 
1901	For I well knew that if Ajax could not be wounded by steel much
1902	less he by money and my only chance of captivating him by my personal
1903	attractions had faded So I was at my wit s end no one was ever
1904	more hopelessly enslaved by another All this happened before he and I
1905	went on the expedition to Potidaea there we messed together and I
1906	had the opportunity of observing his extraordinary power of sustaining
1907	fatigue His endurance was simply marvellous when being cut off
1908	from our supplies we were compelled to go without food on such
1909	occasions which often happen in time of war he was superior not only
1910	to me but to everybody there was no one to be compared to him Yet at
1911	a festival he was the only person who had any real powers of
1912	enjoyment though not willing to drink he could if compelled beat
1913	us all at that wonderful to relate no human being had ever seen
1914	Socrates drunk and his powers if I am not mistaken will be tested
1915	before long His fortitude in enduring cold was also surprising There
1916	was a severe frost for the winter in that region is really
1917	tremendous and everybody else either remained indoors or if they
1918	went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes and were well shod 
1919	and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces in the midst of
1920	this Socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress
1921	marched better than the other soldiers who had shoes and they
1922	looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them 
1924	 I have told you one tale and now I must tell you another which
1925	is worth hearing Of the doings and sufferings of the enduring
1926	man while he was on the expedition One morning he was thinking
1927	about something which he could not resolve he would not give it up 
1928	but continued thinking from early dawn until noon there he stood fixed
1929	in thought and at noon attention was drawn to him and the rumour ran
1930	through the wondering crowd that Socrates had been standing and
1931	thinking about something ever since the break of day At last in
1932	the evening after supper some Ionians out of curiosity I should
1933	explain that this was not in winter but in summer brought out
1934	their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch him and see
1935	whether he would stand all night There he stood until the following
1936	morning and with the return of light he offered up a prayer to the
1937	sun and went his way I will also tell if you please and indeed I am
1938	bound to tell of his courage in battle for who but he saved my
1939	life Now this was the engagement in which I received the prize of
1940	valour for I was wounded and he would not leave me but he rescued me
1941	and my arms and he ought to have received the prize of valour which
1942	the generals wanted to confer on me partly on account of my rank 
1943	and I told them so this again Socrates will not impeach or deny 
1944	but he was more eager than the generals that I and not he should
1945	have the prize There was another occasion on which his behaviour
1946	was very remarkable in the flight of the army after the battle of
1947	Delium where he served among the heavy armed I had a better
1948	opportunity of seeing him than at Potidaea for I was myself on
1949	horseback and therefore comparatively out of danger He and Laches
1950	were retreating for the troops were in flight and I met them and
1951	told them not to be discouraged and promised to remain with them and
1952	there you might see him Aristophanes as you describe just as he
1953	is in the streets of Athens stalking like a and rolling his eyes 
1954	calmly contemplating enemies as well as friends and making very
1955	intelligible to anybody even from a distance that whoever attacked
1956	him would be likely to meet with a stout resistance and in this way
1957	he and his companion escaped for this is the sort of man who is
1958	never touched in war those only are pursued who are running away
1959	headlong I particularly observed how superior he was to Laches in
1960	presence of mind Many are the marvels which I might narrate in praise
1961	of Socrates most of his ways might perhaps be paralleled in another
1962	man but his absolute unlikeness to any human being that is or ever
1963	has been is perfectly astonishing You may imagine Brasidas and others
1964	to have been like Achilles or you may imagine Nestor and Antenor to
1965	have been like Perides and the same may be said of other famous
1966	men but of this strange being you will never be able to find any
1967	likeness however remote either among men who now are or who ever
1968	have been other than that which I have already suggested of Silenus
1969	and the satyrs and they represent in a figure not only himself but
1970	his words For although I forgot to mention this to you before his
1971	words are like the images of Silenus which open they are ridiculous
1972	when you first hear them he clothes himself in language that is
1973	like the skin of the wanton satyr for his talk is of pack asses and
1974	smiths and cobblers and curriers and he is always repeating the
1975	same things in the same words so that any ignorant or inexperienced
1976	person might feel disposed to laugh at him but he who opens the
1977	bust and sees what is within will find that they are the only words
1978	which have a meaning in them and also the most divine abounding in
1979	fair images of virtue and of the widest comprehension or rather
1980	extending to the whole duty of a good and honourable man 
1982	 This friends is my praise of Socrates I have added my blame of
1983	him for his ill treatment of me and he has ill treated not only me 
1984	but Charmides the son of Glaucon and Euthydemus the son of Diocles 
1985	and many others in the same way beginning as their lover he has
1986	ended by making them pay their addresses to him Wherefore I say to
1987	you Agathon Be no deceived by him learn from me and take warning 
1988	and do not be a fool and learn by experience as the proverb says 
1990	 When Alcibiades had finished there was a laugh at his
1991	outspokenness for he seemed to be still in love with Socrates You
1992	are sober Alcibiades said Socrates or you would never have gone
1993	so far about to hide the purpose of your satyr s praises for all this
1994	long story is only an ingenious circumlocution of which the point
1995	comes in by the way at the end you want to get up a quarrel between
1996	me and Agathon and your notion is that I ought to love you and nobody
1997	else and that you and you only ought to love Agathon But the plot of
1998	this Satyric or Silenic drama has been detected and you must not
1999	allow him Agathon to set us at variance 
2001	 I believe you are right said Agathon and I am disposed to think
2002	that his intention in placing himself between you and me was only to
2003	divide us but he shall gain nothing by that move for I will go and
2004	lie on the couch next to you 
2006	 Yes yes replied Socrates by all means come here and lie on the
2007	couch below me 
2009	 Alas said Alcibiades how I am fooled by this man he is determined
2010	to get the better of me at every turn I do beseech you allow Agathon
2011	to lie between us 
2013	 Certainly not said Socrates as you praised me and I in turn ought
2014	to praise my neighbour on the right he will be out of order in
2015	praising me again when he ought rather to be praised by me and I must
2016	entreat you to consent to this and not be jealous for I have a great
2017	desire to praise the youth 
2019	 Hurrah cried Agathon I will rise instantly that I may be
2020	praised by Socrates 
2022	 The usual way said Alcibiades where Socrates is no one else has
2023	any chance with the fair and now how readily has he invented a
2024	specious reason for attracting Agathon to himself 
2026	 Agathon arose in order that he might take his place on the couch
2027	by Socrates when suddenly a band of revellers entered and spoiled
2028	the order of the banquet Some one who was going out having left the
2029	door open they had found their way in and made themselves at home 
2030	great confusion ensued and every one was compelled to drink large
2031	quantities of wine Aristodemus said that Eryximachus Phaedrus and
2032	others went away he himself fell asleep and as the nights were long
2033	took a good rest he was awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of
2034	cocks and when he awoke the others were either asleep or had gone
2035	away there remained only Socrates Aristophanes and Agathon who
2036	were drinking out of a large goblet which they passed round and
2037	Socrates was discoursing to them Aristodemus was only half awake and
2038	he did not hear the beginning of the discourse the chief thing
2039	which he remembered was Socrates compelling the other two to
2040	acknowledge that the genius of comedy was the same with that of
2041	tragedy and that the true artist in tragedy was an artist in comedy
2042	also To this they were constrained to assent being drowsy and not
2043	quite following the argument And first of all Aristophanes dropped
2044	off then when the day was already dawning Agathon Socrates having
2045	laid them to sleep rose to depart Aristodemus as his manner was 
2046	following him At the Lyceum he took a bath and passed the day as
2047	usual In the evening he retired to rest at his own home 
2049	 THE END
