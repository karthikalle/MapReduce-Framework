5	The Republic
6	By Plato
9	Translated by Benjamin Jowett
11	 
13	THE INTRODUCTION
15	The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception
16	of the Laws and is certainly the greatest of them There are nearer
17	approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist 
18	the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal the form and institutions
19	of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws as works of art 
20	the Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence But no
21	other Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same
22	perfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the world 
23	or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old and
24	not of one age only but of all Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper
25	irony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic power 
26	Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave
27	life and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy The
28	Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped 
29	here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers
30	ever attained Plato among the Greeks like Bacon among the moderns 
31	was the first who conceived a method of knowledge although neither
32	of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance
33	of truth and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of
34	science which was not yet realized He was the greatest metaphysical
35	genius whom the world has seen and in him more than in any other
36	ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge are contained The
37	sciences of logic and psychology which have supplied so many instruments
38	of thought to after ages are based upon the analyses of Socrates
39	and Plato The principles of definition the law of contradiction 
40	the fallacy of arguing in a circle the distinction between the essence
41	and accidents of a thing or notion between means and ends between
42	causes and conditions also the division of the mind into the rational 
43	concupiscent and irascible elements or of pleasures and desires
44	into necessary and unnecessary these and other great forms of thought
45	are all of them to be found in the Republic and were probably first
46	invented by Plato The greatest of all logical truths and the one
47	of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference
48	between words and things has been most strenuously insisted on by
49	him although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his
50	own writings But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic
51	is still veiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines
52	to contemplate all truth and all existence is very unlike the doctrine
53	of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered 
55	Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of
56	a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history
57	of Athens as well as a political and physical philosophy The fragment
58	of the Critias has given birth to a world famous fiction second only
59	in importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur and is
60	said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the
61	sixteenth century This mythical tale of which the subject was a
62	history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis 
63	is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon to which
64	it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers
65	to the poems of Homer It would have told of a struggle for Liberty 
66	intended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas We may judge
67	from the noble commencement of the Timaeus from the fragment of the
68	Critias itself and from the third book of the Laws in what manner
69	Plato would have treated this high argument We can only guess why
70	the great design was abandoned perhaps because Plato became sensible
71	of some incongruity in a fictitious history or because he had lost
72	his interest in it or because advancing years forbade the completion
73	of it and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary
74	narrative ever been finished we should have found Plato himself sympathizing
75	with the struggle for Hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph
76	over Marathon and Salamis perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus
77	where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire How brave
78	a thing is freedom of speech which has made the Athenians so far
79	exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness or more probably 
80	attributing the victory to the ancient good order of Athens and to
81	the favor of Apollo and Athene 
83	Again Plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz or leader
84	of a goodly band of followers for in the Republic is to be found
85	the original of Cicero s De Republica of St Augustine s City of
86	God of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More and of the numerous other imaginary
87	States which are framed upon the same model The extent to which Aristotle
88	or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has
89	been little recognized and the recognition is the more necessary
90	because it is not made by Aristotle himself The two philosophers
91	had more in common than they were conscious of and probably some
92	elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle In English
93	philosophy too many affinities may be traced not only in the works
94	of the Cambridge Platonists but in great original writers like Berkeley
95	or Coleridge to Plato and his ideas That there is a truth higher
96	than experience of which the mind bears witness to herself is a
97	conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted 
98	and is perhaps gaining ground Of the Greek authors who at the Renaissance
99	brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence 
100	The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education of
101	which the writings of Milton and Locke Rousseau Jean Paul and Goethe
102	are the legitimate descendants Like Dante or Bunyan he has a revelation
103	of another life like Bacon he is profoundly impressed with the un
104	unity of knowledge in the early Church he exercised a real influence
105	on theology and at the Revival of Literature on politics Even the
106	fragments of his words when repeated at second hand have in all
107	ages ravished the hearts of men who have seen reflected in them their
108	own higher nature He is the father of idealism in philosophy in
109	politics in literature And many of the latest conceptions of modern
110	thinkers and statesmen such as the unity of knowledge the reign
111	of law and the equality of the sexes have been anticipated in a
112	dream by him 
114	Argument 
116	The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice the nature
117	of which is first hinted at by Cephalus the just and blameless old
118	man then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates
119	and Polemarchus then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained
120	by Socrates reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus 
121	and having become invisible in the individual reappears at length
122	in the ideal State which is constructed by Socrates The first care
123	of the rulers is to be education of which an outline is drawn after
124	the old Hellenic model providing only for an improved religion and
125	morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic a manlier strain
126	of poetry and greater harmony of the individual and the State We
127	are thus led on to the conception of a higher State in which no
128	man calls anything his own and in which there is neither marrying
129	nor giving in marriage and kings are philosophers and philosophers
130	are kings and there is another and higher education intellectual
131	as well as moral and religious of science as well as of art and
132	not of youth only but of the whole of life Such a State is hardly
133	to be realized in this world and would quickly degenerate To the
134	perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover
135	of honor this again declining into democracy and democracy into
136	tyranny in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance
137	to the actual facts When the wheel has come full circle we do not
138	begin again with a new period of human life but we have passed from
139	the best to the worst and there we end The subject is then changed
140	and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly
141	treated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought
142	out to a conclusion Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice
143	removed from the truth and Homer as well as the dramatic poets 
144	having been condemned as an imitator is sent into banishment along
145	with them And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation
146	of a future life 
148	The division into books like all similar divisions is probably later
149	than the age of Plato The natural divisions are five in number 1 
150	Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning 
151	 I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus which
152	is introductory the first book containing a refutation of the popular
153	and sophistical notions of justice and concluding like some of the
154	earlier Dialogues without arriving at any definite result To this
155	is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common
156	opinion and an answer is demanded to the question What is justice 
157	stripped of appearances The second division 2 includes the remainder
158	of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books which are
159	mainly occupied with the construction of the first State and the first
160	education The third division 3 consists of the fifth sixth and
161	seventh books in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject
162	of inquiry and the second State is constructed on principles of communism
163	and ruled by philosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good
164	takes the place of the social and political virtues In the eighth
165	and ninth books 4 the perversions of States and of the individuals
166	who correspond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature
167	of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in the
168	individual man The tenth book 5 is the conclusion of the whole 
169	in which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined 
170	and the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now been
171	assured is crowned by the vision of another 
173	Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted the first
174	 Books I IV containing the description of a State framed generally
175	in accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality while
176	in the second Books V X the Hellenic State is transformed into
177	an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all other governments are
178	the perversions These two points of view are really opposed and
179	the opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato The Republic 
180	like the Phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher light of philosophy
181	breaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple which at last
182	fades away into the heavens Whether this imperfection of structure
183	arises from an enlargement of the plan or from the imperfect reconcilement
184	in the writer s own mind of the struggling elements of thought which
185	are now first brought together by him or perhaps from the composition
186	of the work at different times are questions like the similar question
187	about the Iliad and the Odyssey which are worth asking but which
188	cannot have a distinct answer In the age of Plato there was no regular
189	mode of publication and an author would have the less scruple in
190	altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his
191	friends There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid
192	his labors aside for a time or turned from one work to another and
193	such interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a
194	long than of a short writing In all attempts to determine the chronological
195	he order of the Platonic writings on internal evidence this uncertainty
196	about any single Dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing
197	element which must be admitted to affect longer works such as the
198	Republic and the Laws more than shorter ones But on the other hand 
199	the seeming discrepancies of the Republic may only arise out of the
200	discordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in
201	a single whole perhaps without being himself able to recognize the
202	inconsistency which is obvious to us For there is a judgment of after
203	ages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for
204	themselves They do not perceive the want of connection in their own
205	writings or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to
206	those who come after them In the beginnings of literature and philosophy 
207	amid the first efforts of thought and language more inconsistencies
208	occur than now when the paths of speculation are well worn and the
209	meaning of words precisely defined For consistency too is the growth
210	of time and some of the greatest creations of the human mind have
211	been wanting in unity Tried by this test several of the Platonic
212	Dialogues according to our modern ideas appear to be defective 
213	but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different
214	times or by different hands And the supposition that the Republic
215	was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some
216	degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work
217	to another 
219	The second title Concerning Justice is not the one by which the
220	Republic is quoted either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity 
221	and like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues may therefore
222	be assumed to be of later date Morgenstern and others have asked
223	whether the definition of justice which is the professed aim or
224	the construction of the State is the principal argument of the work 
225	The answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces of the
226	same truth for justice is the order of the State and the State is
227	the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society 
228	The one is the soul and the other is the body and the Greek ideal
229	of the State as of the individual is a fair mind in a fair body 
230	In Hegelian phraseology the State is the reality of which justice
231	is the ideal Or described in Christian language the kingdom of
232	God is within and yet develops into a Church or external kingdom 
233	 the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens is reduced
234	to the proportions of an earthly building Or to use a Platonic image 
235	justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through
236	the whole texture And when the constitution of the State is completed 
237	the conception of justice is not dismissed but reappears under the
238	same or different names throughout the work both as the inner law
239	of the individual soul and finally as the principle of rewards and
240	punishments in another life The virtues are based on justice of
241	which common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow and justice
242	is based on the idea of good which is the harmony of the world and
243	is reflected both in the institutions of States and in motions of
244	the heavenly bodies The Timaeus which takes up the political rather
245	than the ethical side of the Republic and is chiefly occupied with
246	hypotheses concerning the outward world yet contains many indications
247	that the same law is supposed to reign over the State over nature 
248	and over man 
250	Too much however has been made of this question both in ancient
251	and in modern times There is a stage of criticism in which all works 
252	whether of nature or of art are referred to design Now in ancient
253	writings and indeed in literature generally there remains often
254	a large element which was not comprehended in the original design 
255	For the plan grows under the author s hand new thoughts occur to
256	him in the act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the
257	end before he begins The reader who seeks to find some one idea under
258	which the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on the vaguest
259	and most general Thus Stallbaum who is dissatisfied with the ordinary
260	explanations of the argument of the Republic imagines himself to
261	have found the true argument in the representation of human life
262	in a State perfected by justice and governed according to the idea
263	of good There may be some use in such general descriptions but
264	they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer The truth
265	is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one nor need
266	anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind
267	is naturally led by the association of ideas and which does not interfere
268	with the general purpose What kind or degree of unity is to be sought
269	after in a building in the plastic arts in poetry in prose is
270	a problem which has to be determined relatively to the subject matter 
271	To Plato himself the inquiry what was the intention of the writer 
272	or what was the principal argument of the Republic would have been
273	hardly intelligible and therefore had better be at once dismissed 
275	Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which 
276	to Plato s own mind are most naturally represented in the form of
277	the State Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah or
278	 the day of the Lord or the suffering Servant or people of God 
279	or the Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey 
280	to us at least their great spiritual ideals so through the Greek
281	State Plato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection 
282	which is the idea of good like the sun in the visible world about
283	human perfection which is justice about education beginning in
284	youth and continuing in later years about poets and sophists and
285	tyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about
286	 the world which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom which
287	exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern
288	and rule of human life No such inspired creation is at unity with
289	itself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through
290	them Every shade of light and dark of truth and of fiction which
291	is the veil of truth is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination 
292	It is not all on the same plane it easily passes from ideas to myths
293	and fancies from facts to figures of speech It is not prose but
294	poetry at least a great part of it and ought not to be judged by
295	the rules of logic or the probabilities of history The writer is
296	not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole they take possession
297	of him and are too much for him We have no need therefore to discuss
298	whether a State such as Plato has conceived is practicable or not 
299	or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the
300	mind of the writer For the practicability of his ideas has nothing
301	to do with their truth and the highest thoughts to which he attains
302	may be truly said to bear the greatest marks of design justice
303	more than the external frame work of the State the idea of good more
304	than justice The great science of dialectic or the organization of
305	ideas has no real content but is only a type of the method or spirit
306	in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of
307	all time and all existence It is in the fifth sixth and seventh
308	books that Plato reaches the summit of speculation and these although
309	they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore
310	be regarded as the most important as they are also the most original 
311	portions of the work 
313	It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has
314	been raised by Boeckh respecting the imaginary date at which the
315	conversation was held the year 411 B C which is proposed by him
316	will do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especially
317	a writer who like Plato is notoriously careless of chronology only
318	aims at general probability Whether all the persons mentioned in
319	the Republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty
320	which would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work forty years
321	later or to Plato himself at the time of writing any more than to
322	Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatly
323	trouble us now Yet this may be a question having no answer which
324	is still worth asking because the investigation shows that we can
325	not argue historically from the dates in Plato it would be useless
326	therefore to waste time in inventing far fetched reconcilements of
327	them in order avoid chronological difficulties such for example 
328	as the conjecture of C F Hermann that Glaucon and Adeimantus are
329	not the brothers but the uncles of Plato or the fancy of Stallbaum
330	that Plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at
331	which some of his Dialogues were written 
333	Characters 
335	The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus Polemarchus 
336	Thrasymachus Socrates Glaucon and Adeimantus Cephalus appears
337	in the introduction only Polemarchus drops at the end of the first
338	argument and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the
339	first book The main discussion is carried on by Socrates Glaucon 
340	and Adeimantus Among the company are Lysias the orator and Euthydemus 
341	the sons of Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus an unknown Charmantides
342	 these are mute auditors also there is Cleitophon who once interrupts 
343	where as in the Dialogue which bears his name he appears as the
344	friend and ally of Thrasymachus 
346	Cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engaged in
347	offering a sacrifice He is the pattern of an old man who has almost
348	done with life and is at peace with himself and with all mankind 
349	He feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below and seems to
350	linger around the memory of the past He is eager that Socrates should
351	come to visit him fond of the poetry of the last generation happy
352	in the consciousness of a well spent life glad at having escaped
353	from the tyranny of youthful lusts His love of conversation his
354	affection his indifference to riches even his garrulity are interesting
355	traits of character He is not one of those who have nothing to say 
356	because their whole mind has been absorbed in making money Yet he
357	acknowledges that riches have the advantage of placing men above the
358	temptation to dishonesty or falsehood The respectful attention shown
359	to him by Socrates whose love of conversation no less than the mission
360	imposed upon him by the Oracle leads him to ask questions of all
361	men young and old alike should also be noted Who better suited
362	to raise the question of justice than Cephalus whose life might seem
363	to be the expression of it The moderation with which old age is pictured
364	by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic 
365	not only of him but of Greek feeling generally and contrasts with
366	the exaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute The evening of life
367	is described by Plato in the most expressive manner yet with the
368	fewest possible touches As Cicero remarks Ep ad Attic iv 16 
369	the aged Cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which
370	follows and which he could neither have understood nor taken part
371	in without a violation of dramatic propriety 
373	His son and heir Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness
374	of youth he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene 
375	and will not let him off on the subject of women and children Like
376	Cephalus he is limited in his point of view and represents the proverbial
377	stage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles 
378	and he quotes Simonides as his father had quoted Pindar But after
379	this he has no more to say the answers which he makes are only elicited
380	from him by the dialectic of Socrates He has not yet experienced
381	the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and Adeimantus nor is
382	he sensible of the necessity of refuting them he belongs to the pre Socratic
383	or pre dialectical age He is incapable of arguing and is bewildered
384	by Socrates to such a degree that he does not know what he is saying 
385	He is made to admit that justice is a thief and that the virtues
386	follow the analogy of the arts From his brother Lysias we learn that
387	he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants but no allusion is here made
388	to his fate nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his family
389	were of Syracusan origin and had migrated from Thurii to Athens 
391	The Chalcedonian giant Thrasymachus of whom we have already heard
392	in the Phaedrus is the personification of the Sophists according
393	to Plato s conception of them in some of their worst characteristics 
394	He is vain and blustering refusing to discourse unless he is paid 
395	fond of making an oration and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable
396	Socrates but a mere child in argument and unable to foresee that
397	the next move to use a Platonic expression will shut him up 
398	He has reached the stage of framing general notions and in this respect
399	is in advance of Cephalus and Polemarchus But he is incapable of
400	defending them in a discussion and vainly tries to cover his confusion
401	in banter and insolence Whether such doctrines as are attributed
402	to him by Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist
403	is uncertain in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality
404	might easily grow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers
405	in Thucydides but we are concerned at present with Plato s description
406	of him and not with the historical reality The inequality of the
407	contest adds greatly to the humor of the scene The pompous and empty
408	Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic 
409	who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him 
410	He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates but his noisy and
411	imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his
412	assailant His determination to cram down their throats or put bodily
413	into their souls his own words elicits a cry of horror from Socrates 
414	The state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process
415	of the argument Nothing is more amusing than his complete submission
416	when he has been once thoroughly beaten At first he seems to continue
417	the discussion with reluctance but soon with apparent good will 
418	and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two
419	occasional remarks When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously protected
420	by Socrates as one who has never been his enemy and is now his friend 
421	From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle s Rhetoric we learn
422	that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note
423	whose writings were preserved in later ages The play on his name
424	which was made by his contemporary Herodicus thou wast ever bold
425	in battle seems to show that the description of him is not devoid
426	of verisimilitude 
428	When Thrasymachus has been silenced the two principal respondents 
429	Glaucon and Adeimantus appear on the scene here as in Greek tragedy 
430	three actors are introduced At first sight the two sons of Ariston
431	may seem to wear a family likeness like the two friends Simmias and
432	Cebes in the Phaedo But on a nearer examination of them the similarity
433	vanishes and they are seen to be distinct characters Glaucon is
434	the impetuous youth who can just never have enough of fechting cf 
435	the character of him in Xen Mem iii 6 the man of pleasure who
436	is acquainted with the mysteries of love the juvenis qui gaudet
437	canibus and who improves the breed of animals the lover of art
438	and music who has all the experiences of youthful life He is full
439	of quickness and penetration piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes
440	of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty he turns out to the light
441	the seamy side of human life and yet does not lose faith in the just
442	and true It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous
443	relation of the philosopher to the world to whom a state of simplicity
444	is a city of pigs who is always prepared with a jest when the argument
445	offers him an opportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor
446	of Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs
447	of music or in the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior
448	of the citizens of democracy His weaknesses are several times alluded
449	to by Socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by
450	his brother Adeimantus He is a soldier and like Adeimantus has
451	been distinguished at the battle of Megara 
453	The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounder
454	objections are commonly put into his mouth Glaucon is more demonstrative 
455	and generally opens the game Adeimantus pursues the argument further 
456	Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth Adeimantus
457	has the maturer judgment of a grown up man of the world In the second
458	book when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered
459	without regard to their consequences Adeimantus remarks that they
460	are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences 
461	and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the
462	fourth book that Socrates falls in making his citizens happy and
463	is answered that happiness is not the first but the second thing 
464	not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good government
465	of a State In the discussion about religion and mythology Adeimantus
466	is the respondent but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries
467	on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to
468	the end of the book It is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism
469	of common sense on the Socratic method of argument and who refuses
470	to let Socrates pass lightly over the question of women and children 
471	It is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative 
472	as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the Dialogue 
473	For example throughout the greater part of the sixth book the causes
474	of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of
475	good are discussed with Adeimantus Then Glaucon resumes his place
476	of principal respondent but he has a difficulty in apprehending the
477	higher education of Socrates and makes some false hits in the course
478	of the discussion Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion
479	to his brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State 
480	in the next book he is again superseded and Glaucon continues to
481	the end 
483	Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive
484	stages of morality beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden
485	time who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating
486	his life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalization
487	of the Sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the great
488	teacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced
489	by them and desire to go deeper into the nature of things These
490	too like Cephalus Polemarchus Thrasymachus are clearly distinguished
491	from one another Neither in the Republic nor in any other Dialogue
492	of Plato is a single character repeated 
494	The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent 
495	In the first book we have more of the real Socrates such as he is
496	depicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon in the earliest Dialogues
497	of Plato and in the Apology He is ironical provoking questioning 
498	the old enemy of the Sophists ready to put on the mask of Silenus
499	as well as to argue seriously But in the sixth book his enmity towards
500	the Sophists abates he acknowledges that they are the representatives
501	rather than the corrupters of the world He also becomes more dogmatic
502	and constructive passing beyond the range either of the political
503	or the speculative ideas of the real Socrates In one passage Plato
504	himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates 
505	who had passed his whole life in philosophy to give his own opinion
506	and not to be always repeating the notions of other men There is
507	no evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect
508	State were comprehended in the Socratic teaching though he certainly
509	dwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes cp Xen 
510	Mem i 4 Phaedo 97 and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or
511	forty years of public teaching could hardly have falled to touch
512	on the nature of family relations for which there is also some positive
513	evidence in the Memorabilia Mem i 2 51 foll The Socratic method
514	is nominally retained and every inference is either put into the
515	mouth of the respondent or represented as the common discovery of
516	him and Socrates But any one can see that this is a mere form of
517	which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances The method
518	of inquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help
519	of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points
520	of view 
522	The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon when
523	he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an
524	investigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps give
525	the answer to a question more fluently than another 
527	Neither can we be absolutely certain that Socrates himself taught
528	the immortality of the soul which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon
529	in the Republic nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths
530	or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction or that
531	he would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology 
532	His favorite oath is retained and a slight mention is made of the
533	daemonium or internal sign which is alluded to by Socrates as a
534	phenomenon peculiar to himself A real element of Socratic teaching 
535	which is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other Dialogues
536	of Plato is the use of example and illustration taphorhtika auto
537	prhospherhontez Let us apply the test of common instances You 
538	says Adeimantus ironically in the sixth book are so unaccustomed
539	to speak in images And this use of examples or images though truly
540	Socratic in origin is enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form
541	of an allegory or parable which embodies in the concrete what has
542	been already described or is about to be described in the abstract 
543	Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the
544	divisions of knowledge in Book VI The composite animal in Book IX
545	is an allegory of the parts of the soul The noble captain and the
546	ship and the true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of
547	the people to the philosophers in the State which has been described 
548	Other figures such as the dog in the second third and fourth books 
549	or the marriage of the portionless maiden in the sixth book or the
550	drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books also form links of
551	connection in long passages or are used to recall previous discussions 
553	Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes
554	him as not of this world And with this representation of him the
555	ideal State and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance 
556	though they can not be shown to have been speculations of Socrates 
557	To him as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious 
558	when they looked upward the world seemed to be the embodiment of
559	error and evil The common sense of mankind has revolted against this
560	view or has only partially admitted it And even in Socrates himself
561	the sterner judgment of the multitude at times passes into a sort
562	of ironical pity or love Men in general are incapable of philosophy 
563	and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher but their misunderstanding
564	of him is unavoidable for they have never seen him as he truly is
565	in his own image they are only acquainted with artificial systems
566	possessing no native force of truth words which admit of many applications 
567	Their leaders have nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant
568	of their own stature But they are to be pitied or laughed at not
569	to be quarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they
570	could only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra s head This moderation
571	towards those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features
572	of Socrates in the Republic In all the different representations
573	of Socrates whether of Xenophon or Plato and the differences of
574	the earlier or later Dialogues he always retains the character of
575	the unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth without which
576	he would have ceased to be Socrates 
578	Leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of the Republic 
579	and then proceed to consider 1 The general aspects of this Hellenic
580	ideal of the State 2 The modern lights in which the thoughts of
581	Plato may be read

585	BOOK I
587	Socrates GLAUCON 
589	I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston 
590	that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess and also because
591	I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival 
592	which was a new thing I was delighted with the procession of the
593	inhabitants but that of the Thracians was equally if not more beautiful 
594	When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle we turned
595	in the direction of the city and at that instant Polemarchus the
596	son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we
597	were starting on our way home and told his servant to run and bid
598	us wait for him The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind 
599	and said Polemarchus desires you to wait 
601	I turned round and asked him where his master was 
602	There he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait 
604	Certainly we will said Glaucon and in a few minutes Polemarchus
605	appeared and with him Adeimantus Glaucon s brother Niceratus the
606	son of Nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
608	Socrates POLEMARCHUS GLAUCON ADEIMANTUS 
610	Polemarchus said to me I perceive Socrates that you and our companion
611	are already on your way to the city 
613	You are not far wrong I said 
614	But do you see he rejoined how many we are 
615	Of course 
616	And are you stronger than all these for if not you will have to
617	remain where you are 
619	May there not be the alternative I said that we may persuade you
620	to let us go 
622	But can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
624	Certainly not replied Glaucon 
625	Then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
627	Adeimantus added Has no one told you of the torch race on horseback
628	in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
630	With horses I replied That is a novelty Will horsemen carry torches
631	and pass them one to another during the race 
633	Yes said Polemarchus and not only so but a festival will he celebrated
634	at night which you certainly ought to see Let us rise soon after
635	supper and see this festival there will be a gathering of young men 
636	and we will have a good talk Stay then and do not be perverse 
638	Glaucon said I suppose since you insist that we must 
640	Very good I replied 
642	Glaucon CEPHALUS SOCRATES 
644	Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house and there we found
645	his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus and with them Thrasymachus the
646	Chalcedonian Charmantides the Paeanian and Cleitophon the son of
647	Aristonymus There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus whom
648	I had not seen for a long time and I thought him very much aged 
649	He was seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head 
650	for he had been sacrificing in the court and there were some other
651	chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down
652	by him He saluted me eagerly and then he said 
654	You don t come to see me Socrates as often as you ought If I were
655	still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me But
656	at my age I can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come
657	oftener to the Piraeus For let me tell you that the more the pleasures
658	of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm
659	of conversation Do not then deny my request but make our house your
660	resort and keep company with these young men we are old friends 
661	and you will be quite at home with us 
663	I replied There is nothing which for my part I like better Cephalus 
664	than conversing with aged men for I regard them as travellers who
665	have gone a journey which I too may have to go and of whom I ought
666	to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult 
667	And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have
668	arrived at that time which the poets call the threshold of old age 
669	 Is life harder towards the end or what report do you give of it 
671	I will tell you Socrates he said what my own feeling is Men of
672	my age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb
673	says and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is
674	 I cannot eat I cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love are
675	fled away there was a good time once but now that is gone and life
676	is no longer life Some complain of the slights which are put upon
677	them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evils
678	their old age is the cause But to me Socrates these complainers
679	seem to blame that which is not really in fault For if old age were
680	the cause I too being old and every other old man would have felt
681	as they do But this is not my own experience nor that of others
682	whom I have known How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles when
683	in answer to the question How does love suit with age Sophocles 
684	 are you still the man you were Peace he replied most gladly have
685	I escaped the thing of which you speak I feel as if I had escaped
686	from a mad and furious master His words have often occurred to my
687	mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he
688	uttered them For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and
689	freedom when the passions relax their hold then as Sophocles says 
690	we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only but of many 
691	The truth is Socrates that these regrets and also the complaints
692	about relations are to be attributed to the same cause which is
693	not old age but men s characters and tempers for he who is of a
694	calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age but to
695	him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a
696	burden 
698	I listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might
699	go on Yes Cephalus I said but I rather suspect that people in
700	general are not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that
701	old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happy disposition 
702	but because you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comforter 
704	You are right he replied they are not convinced and there is something
705	in what they say not however so much as they imagine I might answer
706	them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and
707	saying that he was famous not for his own merits but because he was
708	an Athenian If you had been a native of my country or I of yours 
709	neither of us would have been famous And to those who are not rich
710	and are impatient of old age the same reply may be made for to the
711	good poor man old age cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich
712	man ever have peace with himself 
714	May I ask Cephalus whether your fortune was for the most part inherited
715	or acquired by you 
717	Acquired Socrates do you want to know how much I acquired In the
718	art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather 
719	for my grandfather whose name I bear doubled and trebled the value
720	of his patrimony that which he inherited being much what I possess
721	now but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is
722	at present and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not
723	less but a little more than I received 
725	That was why I asked you the question I replied because I see that
726	you are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather
727	of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have
728	acquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money
729	as a creation of their own resembling the affection of authors for
730	their own poems or of parents for their children besides that natural
731	love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them
732	and all men And hence they are very bad company for they can talk
733	about nothing but the praises of wealth That is true he said 
735	Yes that is very true but may I ask another question What do you
736	consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
737	wealth 
739	One he said of which I could not expect easily to convince others 
740	For let me tell you Socrates that when a man thinks himself to be
741	near death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had
742	before the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted
743	there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but now
744	he is tormented with the thought that they may be true either from
745	the weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
746	place he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarms
747	crowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider what
748	wrongs he has done to others And when he finds that the sum of his
749	transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up
750	in his sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings But
751	to him who is conscious of no sin sweet hope as Pindar charmingly
752	says is the kind nurse of his age 
754	Hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and
755	holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey 
756	 hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
758	How admirable are his words And the great blessing of riches I do
759	not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had no occasion
760	to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally or unintentionally 
761	and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension
762	about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men Now
763	to this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes 
764	and therefore I say that setting one thing against another of the
765	many advantages which wealth has to give to a man of sense this is
766	in my opinion the greatest 
768	Well said Cephalus I replied but as concerning justice what is
769	it to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than this 
770	And even to this are there not exceptions Suppose that a friend when
771	in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them
772	when he is not in his right mind ought I to give them back to him 
773	No one would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so 
774	any more than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth
775	to one who is in his condition 
777	You are quite right he replied 
778	But then I said speaking the truth and paying your debts is not
779	a correct definition of justice 
781	Cephalus SOCRATES POLEMARCHUS 
783	Quite correct Socrates if Simonides is to be believed said Polemarchus
784	interposing 
786	I fear said Cephalus that I must go now for I have to look after
787	the sacrifices and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the
788	company 
790	Is not Polemarchus your heir I said 
791	To be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
793	Socrates POLEMARCHUS 
795	Tell me then O thou heir of the argument what did Simonides say 
796	and according to you truly say about justice 
798	He said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so he
799	appears to me to be right 
801	I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man 
802	but his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clear
803	to me For he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that
804	I ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to
805	one who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet a
806	deposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
808	True 
809	Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by
810	no means to make the return 
812	Certainly not 
813	When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he did
814	not mean to include that case 
816	Certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good
817	to a friend and never evil 
819	You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury
820	of the receiver if the two parties are friends is not the repayment
821	of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
823	Yes 
824	And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
825	To be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and an
826	enemy as I take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper
827	to him that is to say evil 
829	Simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to have spoken
830	darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to say that justice
831	is the giving to each man what is proper to him and this he termed
832	a debt 
834	That must have been his meaning he said 
835	By heaven I replied and if we asked him what due or proper thing
836	is given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that he
837	would make to us 
839	He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink
840	to human bodies 
842	And what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
844	Seasoning to food 
845	And what is that which justice gives and to whom 
846	If Socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding
847	instances then justice is the art which gives good to friends and
848	evil to enemies 
850	That is his meaning then 
851	I think so 
852	And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies
853	in time of sickness 
855	The physician 
856	Or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
858	The pilot 
859	And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just
860	man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
862	In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other 
864	But when a man is well my dear Polemarchus there is no need of a
865	physician 
867	No 
868	And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
869	No 
870	Then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
871	I am very far from thinking so 
872	You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
874	Yes 
875	Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
876	Yes 
877	Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is what you
878	mean 
880	Yes 
881	And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of
882	peace 
884	In contracts Socrates justice is of use 
885	And by contracts you mean partnerships 
886	Exactly 
887	But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better
888	partner at a game of draughts 
890	The skilful player 
891	And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful
892	or better partner than the builder 
894	Quite the reverse 
895	Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner
896	than the harp player as in playing the harp the harp player is certainly
897	a better partner than the just man 
899	In a money partnership 
900	Yes Polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do not
901	want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse 
902	a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would
903	he not 
905	Certainly 
906	And when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would
907	be better 
909	True 
910	Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man
911	is to be preferred 
913	When you want a deposit to be kept safely 
914	You mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
915	Precisely 
916	That is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
918	That is the inference 
919	And when you want to keep a pruning hook safe then justice is useful
920	to the individual and to the state but when you want to use it then
921	the art of the vine dresser 
923	Clearly 
924	And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them 
925	you would say that justice is useful but when you want to use them 
926	then the art of the soldier or of the musician 
928	Certainly 
929	And so of all the other things justice is useful when they are
930	useless and useless when they are useful 
932	That is the inference 
933	Then justice is not good for much But let us consider this further
934	point Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in
935	any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
937	Certainly 
938	And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease
939	is best able to create one 
941	True 
942	And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march
943	upon the enemy 
945	Certainly 
946	Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
948	That I suppose is to be inferred 
949	Then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good at stealing
950	it 
952	That is implied in the argument 
953	Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief And this
954	is a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer for
955	he speaking of Autolycus the maternal grandfather of Odysseus who
956	is a favourite of his affirms that 
958	He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury And so you and
959	Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft to
960	be practised however for the good of friends and for the harm of
961	enemies that was what you were saying 
963	No certainly not that though I do not now know what I did say but
964	I still stand by the latter words 
966	Well there is another question By friends and enemies do we mean
967	those who are so really or only in seeming 
969	Surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks
970	good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
972	Yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many who are
973	not good seem to be so and conversely 
975	That is true 
976	Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends 
977	True 
979	And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and
980	evil to the good 
982	Clearly 
983	But the good are just and would not do an injustice 
984	True 
985	Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do
986	no wrong 
988	Nay Socrates the doctrine is immoral 
989	Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the
990	unjust 
992	I like that better 
993	But see the consequence Many a man who is ignorant of human nature
994	has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought to do harm
995	to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit but if
996	so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed
997	to be the meaning of Simonides 
999	Very true he said and I think that we had better correct an error
1000	into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words friend 
1001	and enemy 
1003	What was the error Polemarchus I asked 
1004	We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good 
1006	And how is the error to be corrected 
1007	We should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as seems 
1008	good and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to be
1009	and is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
1011	You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies 
1013	Yes 
1014	And instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to
1015	do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should further
1016	say It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm
1017	to our enemies when they are evil 
1019	Yes that appears to me to be the truth 
1020	But ought the just to injure any one at all 
1021	Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies 
1023	When horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
1025	The latter 
1026	Deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses not
1027	of dogs 
1029	Yes of horses 
1030	And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and not of
1031	horses 
1033	Of course 
1034	And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is
1035	the proper virtue of man 
1037	Certainly 
1038	And that human virtue is justice 
1039	To be sure 
1040	Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
1041	That is the result 
1042	But can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
1043	Certainly not 
1044	Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
1045	Impossible 
1046	And can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general can
1047	the good by virtue make them bad 
1049	Assuredly not 
1050	Any more than heat can produce cold 
1051	It cannot 
1052	Or drought moisture 
1053	Clearly not 
1054	Nor can the good harm any one 
1055	Impossible 
1056	And the just is the good 
1057	Certainly 
1058	Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man 
1059	but of the opposite who is the unjust 
1061	I think that what you say is quite true Socrates 
1062	Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts 
1063	and that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends and evil
1064	the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is not wise 
1065	for it is not true if as has been clearly shown the injuring of
1066	another can be in no case just 
1068	I agree with you said Polemarchus 
1069	Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes
1070	such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus or any other wise
1071	man or seer 
1073	I am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
1074	Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be 
1075	Whose 
1076	I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban 
1077	or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinion of his
1078	own power was the first to say that justice is doing good to your
1079	friends and harm to your enemies 
1081	Most true he said 
1082	Yes I said but if this definition of justice also breaks down what
1083	other can be offered 
1085	Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made
1086	an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had been put
1087	down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end But when
1088	Polemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause he could
1089	no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he came at us
1090	like a wild beast seeking to devour us We were quite panic stricken
1091	at the sight of him 
1093	Socrates POLEMARCHUS THRASYMACHUS 
1095	He roared out to the whole company What folly Socrates has taken
1096	possession of you all And why sillybillies do you knock under to
1097	one another I say that if you want really to know what justice is 
1098	you should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honour
1099	to yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your own
1100	answer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer And
1101	now I will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit
1102	or gain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me 
1103	I must have clearness and accuracy 
1105	I was panic stricken at his words and could not look at him without
1106	trembling Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him 
1107	I should have been struck dumb but when I saw his fury rising I
1108	looked at him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
1110	Thrasymachus I said with a quiver don t be hard upon us Polemarchus
1111	and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument but
1112	I can assure you that the error was not intentional If we were seeking
1113	for a piece of gold you would not imagine that we were knocking
1114	under to one another and so losing our chance of finding it And
1115	why when we are seeking for justice a thing more precious than many
1116	pieces of gold do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another
1117	and not doing our utmost to get at the truth Nay my good friend 
1118	we are most willing and anxious to do so but the fact is that we
1119	cannot And if so you people who know all things should pity us and
1120	not be angry with us 
1122	How characteristic of Socrates he replied with a bitter laugh that s
1123	your ironical style Did I not foresee have I not already told you 
1124	that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer and try irony
1125	or any other shuffle in order that he might avoid answering 
1127	You are a philosopher Thrasymachus I replied and well know that
1128	if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care to prohibit
1129	him whom you ask from answering twice six or three times four or
1130	six times two or four times three for this sort of nonsense will
1131	not do for me then obviously that is your way of putting the
1132	question no one can answer you But suppose that he were to retort 
1133	 Thrasymachus what do you mean If one of these numbers which you
1134	interdict be the true answer to the question am I falsely to say
1135	some other number which is not the right one is that your meaning 
1136	 How would you answer him 
1138	Just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
1139	Why should they not be I replied and even if they are not but only
1140	appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to say what
1141	he thinks whether you and I forbid him or not 
1143	I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers 
1145	I dare say that I may notwithstanding the danger if upon reflection
1146	I approve of any of them 
1148	But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better he
1149	said than any of these What do you deserve to have done to you 
1151	Done to me as becomes the ignorant I must learn from the wise
1152	 that is what I deserve to have done to me 
1154	What and no payment a pleasant notion 
1155	I will pay when I have the money I replied 
1157	Socrates THRASYMACHUS GLAUCON 
1159	But you have Socrates said Glaucon and you Thrasymachus need
1160	be under no anxiety about money for we will all make a contribution
1161	for Socrates 
1163	Yes he replied and then Socrates will do as he always does refuse
1164	to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answer of some
1165	one else 
1167	Why my good friend I said how can any one answer who knows and
1168	says that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faint
1169	notions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter them 
1170	The natural thing is that the speaker should be some one like yourself
1171	who professes to know and can tell what he knows Will you then kindly
1172	answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
1174	Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus 
1175	as any one might see was in reality eager to speak for he thought
1176	that he had an excellent answer and would distinguish himself But
1177	at first he to insist on my answering at length he consented to begin 
1178	Behold he said the wisdom of Socrates he refuses to teach himself 
1179	and goes about learning of others to whom he never even says thank
1180	you 
1182	That I learn of others I replied is quite true but that I am ungrateful
1183	I wholly deny Money I have none and therefore I pay in praise which
1184	is all I have and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to
1185	me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer for
1186	I expect that you will answer well 
1188	Listen then he said I proclaim that justice is nothing else than
1189	the interest of the stronger And now why do you not me But of course
1190	you won t 
1192	Let me first understand you I replied justice as you say is the
1193	interest of the stronger What Thrasymachus is the meaning of this 
1194	You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas the pancratiast is
1195	stronger than we are and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
1196	bodily strength that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good
1197	who are weaker than he is and right and just for us 
1199	That s abominable of you Socrates you take the words in the sense
1200	which is most damaging to the argument 
1202	Not at all my good sir I said I am trying to understand them and
1203	I wish that you would be a little clearer 
1205	Well he said have you never heard that forms of government differ 
1206	there are tyrannies and there are democracies and there are aristocracies 
1208	Yes I know 
1209	And the government is the ruling power in each state 
1210	Certainly 
1211	And the different forms of government make laws democratical aristocratical 
1212	tyrannical with a view to their several interests and these laws 
1213	which are made by them for their own interests are the justice which
1214	they deliver to their subjects and him who transgresses them they
1215	punish as a breaker of the law and unjust And that is what I mean
1216	when I say that in all states there is the same principle of justice 
1217	which is the interest of the government and as the government must
1218	be supposed to have power the only reasonable conclusion is that
1219	everywhere there is one principle of justice which is the interest
1220	of the stronger 
1222	Now I understand you I said and whether you are right or not I will
1223	try to discover But let me remark that in defining justice you have
1224	yourself used the word interest which you forbade me to use It
1225	is true however that in your definition the words of the stronger 
1226	are added 
1228	A small addition you must allow he said 
1229	Great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whether
1230	what you are saying is the truth Now we are both agreed that justice
1231	is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger 
1232	about this addition I am not so sure and must therefore consider
1233	further 
1235	Proceed 
1236	I will and first tell me Do you admit that it is just or subjects
1237	to obey their rulers 
1239	I do 
1240	But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are they sometimes
1241	liable to err 
1243	To be sure he replied they are liable to err 
1244	Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly and
1245	sometimes not 
1247	True 
1248	When they make them rightly they make them agreeably to their interest 
1249	when they are mistaken contrary to their interest you admit that 
1251	Yes 
1252	And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects and
1253	that is what you call justice 
1255	Doubtless 
1256	Then justice according to your argument is not only obedience to
1257	the interest of the stronger but the reverse 
1259	What is that you are saying he asked 
1260	I am only repeating what you are saying I believe But let us consider 
1261	Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
1262	interest in what they command and also that to obey them is justice 
1263	Has not that been admitted 
1265	Yes 
1266	Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest
1267	of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally command things to
1268	be done which are to their own injury For if as you say justice
1269	is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands in that
1270	case O wisest of men is there any escape from the conclusion that
1271	the weaker are commanded to do not what is for the interest but
1272	what is for the injury of the stronger 
1274	Nothing can be clearer Socrates said Polemarchus 
1276	Socrates CLEITOPHON POLEMARCHUS THRASYMACHUS 
1278	Yes said Cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be his witness 
1280	But there is no need of any witness said Polemarchus for Thrasymachus
1281	himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not
1282	for their own interest and that for subjects to obey them is justice 
1284	Yes Polemarchus Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what
1285	was commanded by their rulers is just 
1287	Yes Cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of
1288	the stronger and while admitting both these propositions he further
1289	acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
1290	subjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows that
1291	justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
1293	But said Cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what
1294	the stronger thought to be his interest this was what the weaker
1295	had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
1297	Those were not his words rejoined Polemarchus 
1299	Socrates THRASYMACHUS 
1301	Never mind I replied if he now says that they are let us accept
1302	his statement Tell me Thrasymachus I said did you mean by justice
1303	what the stronger thought to be his interest whether really so or
1304	not 
1306	Certainly not he said Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken
1307	the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
1309	Yes I said my impression was that you did so when you admitted
1310	that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
1312	You argue like an informer Socrates Do you mean for example that
1313	he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken 
1314	or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or
1315	grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake in respect of
1316	the mistake True we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian
1317	has made a mistake but this is only a way of speaking for the fact
1318	is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever
1319	makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies they none
1320	of them err unless their skill fails them and then they cease to
1321	be skilled artists No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when
1322	he is what his name implies though he is commonly said to err and
1323	I adopted the common mode of speaking But to be perfectly accurate 
1324	since you are such a lover of accuracy we should say that the ruler 
1325	in so far as he is the ruler is unerring and being unerring always
1326	commands that which is for his own interest and the subject is required
1327	to execute his commands and therefore as I said at first and now
1328	repeat justice is the interest of the stronger 
1330	Indeed Thrasymachus and do I really appear to you to argue like
1331	an informer 
1333	Certainly he replied 
1334	And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring
1335	you in the argument 
1337	Nay he replied suppose is not the word I know it but you will
1338	be found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
1340	I shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid any misunderstanding
1341	occurring between us in future let me ask in what sense do you speak
1342	of a ruler or stronger whose interest as you were saying he being
1343	the superior it is just that the inferior should execute is he
1344	a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term 
1346	In the strictest of all senses he said And now cheat and play the
1347	informer if you can I ask no quarter at your hands But you never
1348	will be able never 
1350	And do you imagine I said that I am such a madman as to try and
1351	cheat Thrasymachus I might as well shave a lion 
1353	Why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
1355	Enough I said of these civilities It will be better that I should
1356	ask you a question Is the physician taken in that strict sense of
1357	which you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of money 
1358	And remember that I am now speaking of the true physician 
1360	A healer of the sick he replied 
1361	And the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captain of
1362	sailors or a mere sailor 
1364	A captain of sailors 
1365	The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into
1366	account neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot by which
1367	he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but is significant
1368	of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
1370	Very true he said 
1371	Now I said every art has an interest 
1372	Certainly 
1373	For which the art has to consider and provide 
1374	Yes that is the aim of art 
1375	And the interest of any art is the perfection of it this and nothing
1376	else 
1378	What do you mean 
1379	I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body 
1380	Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self sufficing or has
1381	wants I should reply Certainly the body has wants for the body
1382	may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore interests to
1383	which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin and intention
1384	of medicine as you will acknowledge Am I not right 
1386	Quite right he replied 
1387	But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in
1388	any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight
1389	or the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art to
1390	provide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself 
1391	I say any similar liability to fault or defect and does every art
1392	require another supplementary art to provide for its interests and
1393	that another and another without end Or have the arts to look only
1394	after their own interests Or have they no need either of themselves
1395	or of another having no faults or defects they have no need to
1396	correct them either by the exercise of their own art or of any other 
1397	they have only to consider the interest of their subject matter For
1398	every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is
1399	to say while perfect and unimpaired Take the words in your precise
1400	sense and tell me whether I am not right 
1402	Yes clearly 
1403	Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but the
1404	interest of the body 
1406	True he said 
1407	Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art
1408	of horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do any other
1409	arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care only for
1410	that which is the subject of their art 
1412	True he said 
1413	But surely Thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers of
1414	their own subjects 
1416	To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
1417	Then I said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest
1418	of the stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject
1419	and weaker 
1421	He made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finally acquiesced 
1423	Then I continued no physician in so far as he is a physician considers
1424	his own good in what he prescribes but the good of his patient for
1425	the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject 
1426	and is not a mere money maker that has been admitted 
1428	Yes 
1429	And the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is a ruler
1430	of sailors and not a mere sailor 
1432	That has been admitted 
1433	And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest
1434	of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or the ruler s
1435	interest 
1437	He gave a reluctant Yes 
1438	Then I said Thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in so
1439	far as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his own interest 
1440	but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to
1441	his art to that he looks and that alone he considers in everything
1442	which he says and does 
1444	When we had got to this point in the argument and every one saw that
1445	the definition of justice had been completely upset Thrasymachus 
1446	instead of replying to me said Tell me Socrates have you got a
1447	nurse 
1449	Why do you ask such a question I said when you ought rather to be
1450	answering 
1452	Because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she has
1453	not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
1455	What makes you say that I replied 
1456	Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the
1457	sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of
1458	himself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers of
1459	states if they are true rulers never think of their subjects as
1460	sheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day and
1461	night Oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about
1462	the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just
1463	are in reality another s good that is to say the interest of the
1464	ruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant and injustice
1465	the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just 
1466	he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for his interest 
1467	and minister to his happiness which is very far from being their
1468	own Consider further most foolish Socrates that the just is always
1469	a loser in comparison with the unjust First of all in private contracts 
1470	wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that 
1471	when the partnership is dissolved the unjust man has always more
1472	and the just less Secondly in their dealings with the State when
1473	there is an income tax the just man will pay more and the unjust
1474	less on the same amount of income and when there is anything to be
1475	received the one gains nothing and the other much Observe also what
1476	happens when they take an office there is the just man neglecting
1477	his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses and getting nothing
1478	out of the public because he is just moreover he is hated by his
1479	friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways 
1480	But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man I am speaking 
1481	as before of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of
1482	the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will be most clearly seen
1483	if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal
1484	is the happiest of men and the sufferers or those who refuse to do
1485	injustice are the most miserable that is to say tyranny which by
1486	fraud and force takes away the property of others not little by little
1487	but wholesale comprehending in one things sacred as well as profane 
1488	private and public for which acts of wrong if he were detected perpetrating
1489	any one of them singly he would be punished and incur great disgrace
1490	 they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of
1491	temples and man stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves 
1492	But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made
1493	slaves of them then instead of these names of reproach he is termed
1494	happy and blessed not only by the citizens but by all who hear of
1495	his having achieved the consummation of injustice For mankind censure
1496	injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because
1497	they shrink from committing it And thus as I have shown Socrates 
1498	injustice when on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom
1499	and mastery than justice and as I said at first justice is the
1500	interest of the stronger whereas injustice is a man s own profit
1501	and interest 
1503	Thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a bathman deluged
1504	our ears with his words had a mind to go away But the company would
1505	not let him they insisted that he should remain and defend his position 
1506	and I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us 
1507	Thrasymachus I said to him excellent man how suggestive are your
1508	remarks And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught
1509	or learned whether they are true or not Is the attempt to determine
1510	the way of man s life so small a matter in your eyes to determine
1511	how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage 
1513	And do I differ from you he said as to the importance of the enquiry 
1515	You appear rather I replied to have no care or thought about us 
1516	Thrasymachus whether we live better or worse from not knowing what
1517	you say you know is to you a matter of indifference Prithee friend 
1518	do not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party and
1519	any benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded For my
1520	own part I openly declare that I am not convinced and that I do not
1521	believe injustice to be more gainful than justice even if uncontrolled
1522	and allowed to have free play For granting that there may be an
1523	unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force 
1524	still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice 
1525	and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself 
1526	Perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convince
1527	us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
1529	And how am I to convince you he said if you are not already convinced
1530	by what I have just said what more can I do for you Would you have
1531	me put the proof bodily into your souls 
1533	Heaven forbid I said I would only ask you to be consistent or 
1534	if you change change openly and let there be no deception For I
1535	must remark Thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously
1536	said that although you began by defining the true physician in an
1537	exact sense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of
1538	the shepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the
1539	sheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner or
1540	banqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as
1541	a trader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd Yet surely
1542	the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects 
1543	he has only to provide the best for them since the perfection of
1544	the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are
1545	satisfied And that was what I was saying just now about the ruler 
1546	I conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether
1547	in a state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock
1548	or subjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states 
1549	that is to say the true rulers like being in authority 
1551	Think Nay I am sure of it 
1552	Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly
1553	without payment unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage
1554	not of themselves but of others Let me ask you a question Are not
1555	the several arts different by reason of their each having a separate
1556	function And my dear illustrious friend do say what you think 
1557	that we may make a little progress 
1559	Yes that is the difference he replied 
1560	And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one
1561	 medicine for example gives us health navigation safety at sea 
1562	and so on 
1564	Yes he said 
1565	And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay but
1566	we do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of the
1567	pilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the health
1568	of the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage You would not be inclined
1569	to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine at least
1570	if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
1572	Certainly not 
1573	Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would
1574	not say that the art of payment is medicine 
1576	I should say not 
1577	Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because
1578	a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
1580	Certainly not 
1581	And we have admitted I said that the good of each art is specially
1582	confined to the art 
1584	Yes 
1585	Then if there be any good which all artists have in common that
1586	is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common
1587	use 
1589	True he replied 
1590	And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is
1591	gained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the art
1592	professed by him 
1594	He gave a reluctant assent to this 
1595	Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective
1596	arts But the truth is that while the art of medicine gives health 
1597	and the art of the builder builds a house another art attends them
1598	which is the art of pay The various arts may be doing their own business
1599	and benefiting that over which they preside but would the artist
1600	receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well 
1602	I suppose not 
1603	But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
1605	Certainly he confers a benefit 
1606	Then now Thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neither
1607	arts nor governments provide for their own interests but as we were
1608	before saying they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects
1609	who are the weaker and not the stronger to their good they attend
1610	and not to the good of the superior 
1612	And this is the reason my dear Thrasymachus why as I was just now
1613	saying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take
1614	in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without
1615	remuneration For in the execution of his work and in giving his
1616	orders to another the true artist does not regard his own interest 
1617	but always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulers
1618	may be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes of
1619	payment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
1621	Socrates GLAUCON 
1623	What do you mean Socrates said Glaucon The first two modes of payment
1624	are intelligible enough but what the penalty is I do not understand 
1625	or how a penalty can be a payment 
1627	You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which
1628	to the best men is the great inducement to rule Of course you know
1629	that ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are a disgrace 
1631	Very true 
1632	And for this reason I said money and honour have no attraction for
1633	them good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
1634	and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helping themselves
1635	out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves And not being
1636	ambitious they do not care about honour Wherefore necessity must
1637	be laid upon them and they must be induced to serve from the fear
1638	of punishment And this as I imagine is the reason why the forwardness
1639	to take office instead of waiting to be compelled has been deemed
1640	dishonourable Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
1641	refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself 
1642	And the fear of this as I conceive induces the good to take office 
1643	not because they would but because they cannot help not under the
1644	idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves 
1645	but as a necessity and because they are not able to commit the task
1646	of ruling to any one who is better than themselves or indeed as good 
1647	For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely
1648	of good men then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
1649	as to obtain office is at present then we should have plain proof
1650	that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest 
1651	but that of his subjects and every one who knew this would choose
1652	rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble
1653	of conferring one So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that
1654	justice is the interest of the stronger This latter question need
1655	not be further discussed at present but when Thrasymachus says that
1656	the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just 
1657	his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character 
1658	Which of us has spoken truly And which sort of life Glaucon do
1659	you prefer 
1661	I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous 
1662	he answered 
1664	Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was
1665	rehearsing 
1667	Yes I heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
1669	Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we can that
1670	he is saying what is not true 
1672	Most certainly he replied 
1673	If I said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all
1674	the advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there
1675	must be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on
1676	either side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but if
1677	we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions to
1678	one another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our
1679	own persons 
1681	Very good he said 
1682	And which method do I understand you to prefer I said 
1683	That which you propose 
1684	Well then Thrasymachus I said suppose you begin at the beginning
1685	and answer me You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than
1686	perfect justice 
1688	Socrates GLAUCON THRASYMACHUS 
1690	Yes that is what I say and I have given you my reasons 
1692	And what is your view about them Would you call one of them virtue
1693	and the other vice 
1695	Certainly 
1696	I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
1698	What a charming notion So likely too seeing that I affirm injustice
1699	to be profitable and justice not 
1701	What else then would you say 
1702	The opposite he replied 
1703	And would you call justice vice 
1704	No I would rather say sublime simplicity 
1705	Then would you call injustice malignity 
1706	No I would rather say discretion 
1707	And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
1708	Yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly
1709	unjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations but
1710	perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
1712	Even this profession if undetected has advantages though they are
1713	not to be compared with those of which I was just now speaking 
1715	I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning Thrasymachus I replied 
1716	but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice
1717	with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
1719	Certainly I do so class them 
1720	Now I said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground 
1721	for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had
1722	been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity an answer
1723	might have been given to you on received principles but now I perceive
1724	that you will call injustice honourable and strong and to the unjust
1725	you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before
1726	to the just seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with
1727	wisdom and virtue 
1729	You have guessed most infallibly he replied 
1730	Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument
1731	so long as I have reason to think that you Thrasymachus are speaking
1732	your real mind for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are
1733	not amusing yourself at our expense 
1735	I may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute the
1736	argument is your business 
1738	Very true I said that is what I have to do But will you be so good
1739	as answer yet one more question Does the just man try to gain any
1740	advantage over the just 
1742	Far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creature
1743	which he is 
1745	And would he try to go beyond just action 
1746	He would not 
1747	And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the
1748	unjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
1750	He would think it just and would try to gain the advantage but he
1751	would not be able 
1753	Whether he would or would not be able I said is not to the point 
1754	My question is only whether the just man while refusing to have more
1755	than another just man would wish and claim to have more than the
1756	unjust 
1758	Yes he would 
1759	And what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the just
1760	man and to do more than is just 
1762	Of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
1764	And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the
1765	unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
1767	True 
1768	We may put the matter thus I said the just does not desire more
1769	than his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desires
1770	more than both his like and his unlike 
1772	Nothing he said can be better than that statement 
1773	And the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
1775	Good again he said 
1776	And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them 
1778	Of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those who
1779	are of a certain nature he who is not not 
1781	Each of them I said is such as his like is 
1782	Certainly he replied 
1783	Very good Thrasymachus I said and now to take the case of the arts 
1784	you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician 
1786	Yes 
1787	And which is wise and which is foolish 
1788	Clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish 
1790	And he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he is
1791	foolish 
1793	Yes 
1794	And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
1796	Yes 
1797	And do you think my excellent friend that a musician when he adjusts
1798	the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in
1799	the tightening and loosening the strings 
1801	I do not think that he would 
1802	But he would claim to exceed the non musician 
1803	Of course 
1804	And what would you say of the physician In prescribing meats and
1805	drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the
1806	practice of medicine 
1808	He would not 
1809	But he would wish to go beyond the non physician 
1810	Yes 
1811	And about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether you think
1812	that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice
1813	of saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge Would
1814	he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
1816	That I suppose can hardly be denied 
1817	And what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more than either
1818	the knowing or the ignorant 
1820	I dare say 
1821	And the knowing is wise 
1822	Yes 
1823	And the wise is good 
1824	True 
1825	Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like 
1826	but more than his unlike and opposite 
1828	I suppose so 
1829	Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
1831	Yes 
1832	But did we not say Thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond both
1833	his like and unlike Were not these your words They were 
1835	They were 
1836	And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his
1837	unlike 
1839	Yes 
1840	Then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil
1841	and ignorant 
1843	That is the inference 
1844	And each of them is such as his like is 
1845	That was admitted 
1846	Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil
1847	and ignorant 
1849	Thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as I repeat
1850	them but with extreme reluctance it was a hot summer s day and
1851	the perspiration poured from him in torrents and then I saw what
1852	I had never seen before Thrasymachus blushing As we were now agreed
1853	that justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice and ignorance 
1854	I proceeded to another point 
1856	Well I said Thrasymachus that matter is now settled but were we
1857	not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
1859	Yes I remember he said but do not suppose that I approve of what
1860	you are saying or have no answer if however I were to answer you
1861	would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing therefore either
1862	permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask do so and
1863	I will answer Very good as they say to story telling old women 
1864	and will nod Yes and No 
1866	Certainly not I said if contrary to your real opinion 
1868	Yes he said I will to please you since you will not let me speak 
1869	What else would you have 
1871	Nothing in the world I said and if you are so disposed I will ask
1872	and you shall answer 
1874	Proceed 
1875	Then I will repeat the question which I asked before in order that
1876	our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may
1877	be carried on regularly A statement was made that injustice is stronger
1878	and more powerful than justice but now justice having been identified
1879	with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be stronger than injustice 
1880	if injustice is ignorance this can no longer be questioned by any
1881	one But I want to view the matter Thrasymachus in a different way 
1882	You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly
1883	attempting to enslave other states or may have already enslaved them 
1884	and may be holding many of them in subjection 
1886	True he replied and I will add the best and perfectly unjust state
1887	will be most likely to do so 
1889	I know I said that such was your position but what I would further
1890	consider is whether this power which is possessed by the superior
1891	state can exist or be exercised without justice 
1893	If you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then only with
1894	justice but if I am right then without justice 
1896	I am delighted Thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent and
1897	dissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
1899	That is out of civility to you he replied 
1900	You are very kind I said and would you have the goodness also to
1901	inform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band of
1902	robbers and thieves or any other gang of evil doers could act at
1903	all if they injured one another 
1905	No indeed he said they could not 
1906	But if they abstained from injuring one another then they might act
1907	together better 
1909	Yes 
1910	And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting 
1911	and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not that true Thrasymachus 
1913	I agree he said because I do not wish to quarrel with you 
1915	How good of you I said but I should like to know also whether injustice 
1916	having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever existing among slaves
1917	or among freemen will not make them hate one another and set them
1918	at variance and render them incapable of common action 
1920	Certainly 
1921	And even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarrel
1922	and fight and become enemies to one another and to the just
1924	They will 
1925	And suppose injustice abiding in a single person would your wisdom
1926	say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
1928	Let us assume that she retains her power 
1929	Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that
1930	wherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in
1931	a family or in any other body that body is to begin with rendered
1932	incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction 
1933	and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that
1934	opposes it and with the just Is not this the case 
1936	Yes certainly 
1937	And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person 
1938	in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is
1939	not at unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemy
1940	to himself and the just Is not that true Thrasymachus 
1942	Yes 
1943	And O my friend I said surely the gods are just 
1944	Granted that they are 
1945	But if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the just
1946	will be their friend 
1948	Feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument I will
1949	not oppose you lest I should displease the company 
1951	Well then proceed with your answers and let me have the remainder
1952	of my repast For we have already shown that the just are clearly
1953	wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that the unjust are
1954	incapable of common action nay ing at more that to speak as we did
1955	of men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together is not
1956	strictly true for if they had been perfectly evil they would have
1957	laid hands upon one another but it is evident that there must have
1958	been some remnant of justice in them which enabled them to combine 
1959	if there had not been they would have injured one another as well
1960	as their victims they were but half villains in their enterprises 
1961	for had they been whole villains and utterly unjust they would have
1962	been utterly incapable of action That as I believe is the truth
1963	of the matter and not what you said at first But whether the just
1964	have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question
1965	which we also proposed to consider I think that they have and for
1966	the reasons which to have given but still I should like to examine
1967	further for no light matter is at stake nothing less than the rule
1968	of human life 
1970	Proceed 
1971	I will proceed by asking a question Would you not say that a horse
1972	has some end 
1974	I should 
1975	And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could
1976	not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing 
1978	I do not understand he said 
1979	Let me explain Can you see except with the eye 
1980	Certainly not 
1981	Or hear except with the ear 
1982	No 
1983	These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
1985	They may 
1986	But you can cut off a vine branch with a dagger or with a chisel 
1987	and in many other ways 
1989	Of course 
1990	And yet not so well as with a pruning hook made for the purpose 
1992	True 
1993	May we not say that this is the end of a pruning hook 
1994	We may 
1995	Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning
1996	when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that
1997	which could not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any
1998	other thing 
2000	I understand your meaning he said and assent 
2001	And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence Need
2002	I ask again whether the eye has an end 
2004	It has 
2005	And has not the eye an excellence 
2006	Yes 
2007	And the ear has an end and an excellence also 
2008	True 
2009	And the same is true of all other things they have each of them an
2010	end and a special excellence 
2012	That is so 
2013	Well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their
2014	own proper excellence and have a defect instead 
2016	How can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
2018	You mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which
2019	is sight but I have not arrived at that point yet I would rather
2020	ask the question more generally and only enquire whether the things
2021	which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence 
2022	and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect 
2024	Certainly he replied 
2025	I might say the same of the ears when deprived of their own proper
2026	excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
2028	True 
2029	And the same observation will apply to all other things 
2031	I agree 
2032	Well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil for
2033	example to superintend and command and deliberate and the like Are
2034	not these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly be assigned
2035	to any other 
2037	To no other 
2038	And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
2040	Assuredly he said 
2041	And has not the soul an excellence also 
2042	Yes 
2043	And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that
2044	excellence 
2046	She cannot 
2047	Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent 
2048	and the good soul a good ruler 
2050	Yes necessarily 
2051	And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul and
2052	injustice the defect of the soul 
2054	That has been admitted 
2055	Then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust
2056	man will live ill 
2058	That is what your argument proves 
2059	And he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill the
2060	reverse of happy 
2062	Certainly 
2063	Then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
2064	So be it 
2065	But happiness and not misery is profitable 
2066	Of course 
2067	Then my blessed Thrasymachus injustice can never be more profitable
2068	than justice 
2070	Let this Socrates he said be your entertainment at the Bendidea 
2072	For which I am indebted to you I said now that you have grown gentle
2073	towards me and have left off scolding Nevertheless I have not been
2074	well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours As an epicure
2075	snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table 
2076	he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before so have
2077	I gone from one subject to another without having discovered what
2078	I sought at first the nature of justice I left that enquiry and
2079	turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil
2080	and folly and when there arose a further question about the comparative
2081	advantages of justice and injustice I could not refrain from passing
2082	on to that And the result of the whole discussion has been that I
2083	know nothing at all For I know not what justice is and therefore
2084	I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue nor can
2085	I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

2089	BOOK II
2091	Socrates GLAUCON 
2093	With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion 
2094	but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning For Glaucon 
2095	who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus 
2096	retirement he wanted to have the battle out So he said to me Socrates 
2097	do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded
2098	us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
2100	I should wish really to persuade you I replied if I could 
2102	Then you certainly have not succeeded Let me ask you now How would
2103	you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their
2104	own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example 
2105	harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although
2106	nothing follows from them 
2108	I agree in thinking that there is such a class I replied 
2110	Is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight 
2111	health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their
2112	results 
2114	Certainly I said 
2115	And would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and
2116	the care of the sick and the physician s art also the various ways
2117	of money making these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable 
2118	and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the
2119	sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
2121	There is I said this third class also But why do you ask 
2123	Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place
2124	justice 
2126	In the highest class I replied among those goods which he who
2127	would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of
2128	their results 
2130	Then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be
2131	reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued
2132	for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable
2133	and rather to be avoided 
2135	I know I said that this is their manner of thinking and that this
2136	was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he
2137	censured justice and praised injustice But I am too stupid to be
2138	convinced by him 
2140	I wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then I
2141	shall see whether you and I agree For Thrasymachus seems to me like
2142	a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to
2143	have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have
2144	not yet been made clear Setting aside their rewards and results 
2145	I want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly
2146	work in the soul If you please then I will revive the argument
2147	of Thrasymachus And first I will speak of the nature and origin of
2148	justice according to the common view of them Secondly I will show
2149	that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity 
2150	but not as a good And thirdly I will argue that there is reason
2151	in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than
2152	the life of the just if what they say is true Socrates since I
2153	myself am not of their opinion But still I acknowledge that I am
2154	perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others
2155	dinning in my ears and on the other hand I have never yet heard
2156	the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a
2157	satisfactory way I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself 
2158	then I shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom I think
2159	that I am most likely to hear this and therefore I will praise the
2160	unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will
2161	indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice
2162	and censuring injustice Will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
2164	Indeed I do nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense
2165	would oftener wish to converse 
2167	I am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by
2168	speaking as I proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
2170	Glaucon 
2172	They say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice 
2173	evil but that the evil is greater than the good And so when men
2174	have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both 
2175	not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that
2176	they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there
2177	arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law
2178	is termed by them lawful and just This they affirm to be the origin
2179	and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best
2180	of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst
2181	of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation 
2182	and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated
2183	not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the
2184	inability of men to do injustice For no man who is worthy to be called
2185	a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist 
2186	he would be mad if he did Such is the received account Socrates 
2187	of the nature and origin of justice 
2189	Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because
2190	they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine
2191	something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust
2192	power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will
2193	lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust
2194	man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest 
2195	which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into
2196	the path of justice by the force of law The liberty which we are
2197	supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such
2198	a power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of
2199	Croesus the Lydian According to the tradition Gyges was a shepherd
2200	in the service of the king of Lydia there was a great storm and
2201	an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was
2202	feeding his flock Amazed at the sight he descended into the opening 
2203	where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having
2204	doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature 
2205	as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold
2206	ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended Now
2207	the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send
2208	their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly
2209	he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among
2210	them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when
2211	instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they
2212	began to speak of him as if he were no longer present He was astonished
2213	at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards
2214	and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with
2215	the same result when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible 
2216	when outwards he reappeared Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one
2217	of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he
2218	arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against
2219	the king and slew him and took the kingdom Suppose now that there
2220	were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the
2221	unjust the other no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature
2222	that he would stand fast in justice No man would keep his hands off
2223	what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of
2224	the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure 
2225	or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects
2226	be like a God among men Then the actions of the just would be as
2227	the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same
2228	point And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man
2229	is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good
2230	to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks
2231	that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust For all men believe
2232	in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual
2233	than justice and he who argues as I have been supposing will say
2234	that they are right If you could imagine any one obtaining this power
2235	of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what
2236	was another s he would be thought by the lookers on to be a most
2237	wretched idiot although they would praise him to one another s faces 
2238	and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too
2239	might suffer injustice Enough of this 
2241	Now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and
2242	unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the
2243	isolation to be effected I answer Let the unjust man be entirely
2244	unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away
2245	from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the
2246	work of their respective lives First let the unjust be like other
2247	distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician 
2248	who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits 
2249	and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself So
2250	let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie
2251	hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out
2252	is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just
2253	when you are not Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man
2254	we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction 
2255	but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired
2256	the greatest reputation for justice If he have taken a false step
2257	he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with
2258	effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way
2259	where force is required his courage and strength and command of money
2260	and friends And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness
2261	and simplicity wishing as Aeschylus says to be and not to seem
2262	good There must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will
2263	be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is
2264	just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards 
2265	therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering 
2266	and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former 
2267	Let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then
2268	he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will
2269	be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences And let him
2270	continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust 
2271	When both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and
2272	the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the
2273	happier of the two 
2275	Socrates GLAUCON 
2277	Heavens my dear Glaucon I said how energetically you polish them
2278	up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were
2279	two statues 
2281	I do my best he said And now that we know what they are like there
2282	is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either
2283	of them This I will proceed to describe but as you may think the
2284	description a little too coarse I ask you to suppose Socrates that
2285	the words which follow are not mine Let me put them into the mouths
2286	of the eulogists of injustice They will tell you that the just man
2287	who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have
2288	his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil 
2289	he will be impaled Then he will understand that he ought to seem
2290	only and not to be just the words of Aeschylus may be more truly
2291	spoken of the unjust than of the just For the unjust is pursuing
2292	a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants
2293	to be really unjust and not to seem only 
2295	His mind has a soil deep and fertile 
2296	Out of which spring his prudent counsels In the first place he is
2297	thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom
2298	he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and
2299	deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has
2300	no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public
2301	or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their
2302	expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends 
2303	and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate
2304	gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the
2305	gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than
2306	the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to
2307	the gods And thus Socrates gods and men are said to unite in making
2308	the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
2310	Adeimantus SOCRATES 
2312	I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon when Adeimantus 
2313	his brother interposed Socrates he said you do not suppose that
2314	there is nothing more to be urged 
2316	Why what else is there I answered 
2317	The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
2319	Well then according to the proverb Let brother help brother if
2320	he fails in any part do you assist him although I must confess that
2321	Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take
2322	from me the power of helping justice 
2324	Adeimantus 
2326	Nonsense he replied But let me add something more There is another
2327	side to Glaucon s argument about the praise and censure of justice
2328	and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what
2329	I believe to be his meaning Parents and tutors are always telling
2330	their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not
2331	for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation 
2332	in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those
2333	offices marriages and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among
2334	the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice 
2335	More however is made of appearances by this class of persons than
2336	by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and
2337	will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say 
2338	rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble
2339	Hesiod and Homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks
2340	of the just 
2342	To hear acorns at their summit and bees I the middle 
2343	And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and
2344	many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them And Homer
2345	has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
2347	As the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
2348	Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
2349	Wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
2350	And his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish Still
2351	grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe
2352	to the just they take them down into the world below where they
2353	have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk 
2354	crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality
2355	of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue Some extend their rewards
2356	yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just
2357	shall survive to the third and fourth generation This is the style
2358	in which they praise justice But about the wicked there is another
2359	strain they bury them in a slough in Hades and make them carry water
2360	in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy 
2361	and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the
2362	portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does
2363	their invention supply Such is their manner of praising the one and
2364	censuring the other 
2366	Once more Socrates I will ask you to consider another way of speaking
2367	about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but
2368	is found in prose writers The universal voice of mankind is always
2369	declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and
2370	toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of
2371	attainment and are only censured by law and opinion They say also
2372	that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty 
2373	and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them
2374	both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way
2375	influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak
2376	and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others 
2377	But most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue
2378	and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery
2379	to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked And mendicant
2380	prophets go to rich men s doors and persuade them that they have a
2381	power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man s
2382	own or his ancestor s sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings
2383	and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust 
2384	at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven 
2385	as they say to execute their will And the poets are the authorities
2386	to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words
2387	of Hesiod 
2389	Vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and
2390	her dwelling place is near But before virtue the gods have set toil 
2391	and a tedious and uphill road then citing Homer as a witness that
2392	the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
2394	The gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them
2395	and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by
2396	libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed 
2397	And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus who
2398	were children of the Moon and the Muses that is what they say according
2399	to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals 
2400	but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made
2401	by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally
2402	at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call
2403	mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect
2404	them no one knows what awaits us 
2406	He proceeded And now when the young hear all this said about virtue
2407	and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their
2408	minds likely to be affected my dear Socrates those of them I
2409	mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every
2410	flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions
2411	as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should
2412	walk if they would make the best of life Probably the youth will
2413	say to himself in the words of Pindar 
2415	Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower
2416	which may he a fortress to me all my days For what men say is that 
2417	if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none 
2418	but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable But if 
2419	though unjust I acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life
2420	is promised to me Since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes
2421	over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance I must devote myself 
2422	I will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the
2423	vestibule and exterior of my house behind I will trail the subtle
2424	and crafty fox as Archilochus greatest of sages recommends But
2425	I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often
2426	difficult to which I answer Nothing great is easy Nevertheless 
2427	the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path
2428	along which we should proceed With a view to concealment we will
2429	establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs And there are professors
2430	of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies 
2431	and so partly by persuasion and partly by force I shall make unlawful
2432	gains and not be punished Still I hear a voice saying that the gods
2433	cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled But what if there
2434	are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why
2435	in either case should we mind about concealment And even if there
2436	are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from
2437	tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very
2438	persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices
2439	and soothing entreaties and by offerings Let us be consistent then 
2440	and believe both or neither If the poets speak truly why then we
2441	had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if
2442	we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall
2443	lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep
2444	the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning 
2445	the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished But there
2446	is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for
2447	our unjust deeds Yes my friend will be the reflection but there
2448	are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power That
2449	is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were
2450	their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
2452	On what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather
2453	than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a
2454	deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with
2455	gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the
2456	highest authorities tell us Knowing all this Socrates how can a
2457	man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be
2458	willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when
2459	he hears justice praised And even if there should be some one who
2460	is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that
2461	justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very
2462	ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just
2463	of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom
2464	the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice 
2465	or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man He
2466	only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness 
2467	has not the power of being unjust And this is proved by the fact
2468	that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far
2469	as he can be 
2471	The cause of all this Socrates was indicated by us at the beginning
2472	of the argument when my brother and I told you how astonished we
2473	were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning
2474	with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to
2475	us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed
2476	injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours 
2477	and benefits which flow from them No one has ever adequately described
2478	either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them
2479	abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or
2480	shown that of all the things of a man s soul which he has within him 
2481	justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil Had
2482	this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this
2483	from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep
2484	one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own
2485	watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself
2486	the greatest of evils I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would
2487	seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating and
2488	words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly 
2489	as I conceive perverting their true nature But I speak in this vehement
2490	manner as I must frankly confess to you because I want to hear from
2491	you the opposite side and I would ask you to show not only the superiority
2492	which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the
2493	possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an
2494	evil to him And please as Glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations 
2495	for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and
2496	add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but
2497	the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us
2498	to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with Thrasymachus
2499	in thinking that justice is another s good and the interest of the
2500	stronger and that injustice is a man s own profit and interest though
2501	injurious to the weaker Now as you have admitted that justice is
2502	one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their
2503	results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight
2504	or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and
2505	not merely conventional good I would ask you in your praise of justice
2506	to regard one point only I mean the essential good and evil which
2507	justice and injustice work in the possessors of them Let others praise
2508	justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours
2509	of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which 
2510	coming from them I am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent
2511	your whole life in the consideration of this question unless I hear
2512	the contrary from your own lips I expect something better And therefore 
2513	I say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice 
2514	but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which
2515	makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or
2516	unseen by gods and men 
2518	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
2520	I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus but on
2521	hearing these words I was quite delighted and said Sons of an illustrious
2522	father that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the
2523	admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished
2524	yourselves at the battle of Megara 
2526	 Sons of Ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero 
2527	The epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine
2528	in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice 
2529	and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments And I do believe
2530	that you are not convinced this I infer from your general character 
2531	for had I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted
2532	you But now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my
2533	difficulty in knowing what to say For I am in a strait between two 
2534	on the one hand I feel that I am unequal to the task and my inability
2535	is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with
2536	the answer which I made to Thrasymachus proving as I thought the
2537	superiority which justice has over injustice And yet I cannot refuse
2538	to help while breath and speech remain to me I am afraid that there
2539	would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of
2540	and not lifting up a hand in her defence And therefore I had best
2541	give such help as I can 
2543	Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
2544	drop but to proceed in the investigation They wanted to arrive at
2545	the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly 
2546	about their relative advantages I told them what I really thought 
2547	that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very
2548	good eyes Seeing then I said that we are no great wits I think
2549	that we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus suppose
2550	that a short sighted person had been asked by some one to read small
2551	letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they
2552	might be found in another place which was larger and in which the
2553	letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the
2554	larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would
2555	have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
2557	Very true said Adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to
2558	our enquiry 
2560	I will tell you I replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry 
2561	is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual 
2562	and sometimes as the virtue of a State 
2564	True he replied 
2565	And is not a State larger than an individual 
2566	It is 
2567	Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger
2568	and more easily discernible I propose therefore that we enquire into
2569	the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the State 
2570	and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the
2571	lesser and comparing them 
2573	That he said is an excellent proposal 
2574	And if we imagine the State in process of creation we shall see the
2575	justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also 
2577	I dare say 
2578	When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of
2579	our search will be more easily discovered 
2581	Yes far more easily 
2582	But ought we to attempt to construct one I said for to do so as
2583	I am inclined to think will be a very serious task Reflect therefore 
2585	I have reflected said Adeimantus and am anxious that you should
2586	proceed 
2588	A State I said arises as I conceive out of the needs of mankind 
2589	no one is self sufficing but all of us have many wants Can any other
2590	origin of a State be imagined 
2592	There can I be no other 
2593	Then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply
2594	them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another 
2595	and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation
2596	the body of inhabitants is termed a State 
2598	True he said 
2599	And they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives 
2600	under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
2602	Very true 
2603	Then I said let us begin and create in idea a State and yet the
2604	true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
2606	Of course he replied 
2607	Now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition
2608	of life and existence 
2610	Certainly 
2611	The second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
2613	True 
2614	And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great
2615	demand We may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder 
2616	some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps
2617	some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
2619	Quite right 
2620	The barest notion of a State must include four or five men 
2622	Clearly 
2623	And how will they proceed Will each bring the result of his labours
2624	into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing
2625	for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need
2626	in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as
2627	himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the
2628	trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth
2629	of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining three fourths
2630	of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes 
2631	having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own
2632	wants 
2634	Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not
2635	at producing everything 
2637	Probably I replied that would be the better way and when I hear
2638	you say this I am myself reminded that we are not all alike there
2639	are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different
2640	occupations 
2642	Very true 
2643	And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations 
2644	or when he has only one 
2646	When he has only one 
2647	Further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done
2648	at the right time 
2650	No doubt 
2651	For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business
2652	is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make
2653	the business his first object 
2655	He must 
2656	And if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully
2657	and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which
2658	is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other
2659	things 
2661	Undoubtedly 
2662	Then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman
2663	will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture 
2664	if they are to be good for anything Neither will the builder make
2665	his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and
2666	shoemaker 
2668	True 
2669	Then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers
2670	in our little State which is already beginning to grow 
2672	True 
2673	Yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order
2674	that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as
2675	well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers
2676	fleeces and hides still our State will not be very large 
2678	That is true yet neither will it be a very small State which contains
2679	all these 
2681	Then again there is the situation of the city to find a place
2682	where nothing need be imported is well nigh impossible 
2684	Impossible 
2685	Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required
2686	supply from another city 
2688	There must 
2689	But if the trader goes empty handed having nothing which they require
2690	who would supply his need he will come back empty handed 
2692	That is certain 
2693	And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for
2694	themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate
2695	those from whom their wants are supplied 
2697	Very true 
2698	Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
2700	They will 
2701	Not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
2703	Yes 
2704	Then we shall want merchants 
2705	We shall 
2706	And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors
2707	will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
2709	Yes in considerable numbers 
2710	Then again within the city how will they exchange their productions 
2711	To secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal
2712	objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State 
2714	Clearly they will buy and sell 
2715	Then they will need a market place and a money token for purposes
2716	of exchange 
2718	Certainly 
2719	Suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production
2720	to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange
2721	with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market place 
2723	Not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake
2724	the office of salesmen In well ordered States they are commonly those
2725	who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use
2726	for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give
2727	money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take
2728	money from those who desire to buy 
2730	This want then creates a class of retail traders in our State Is
2731	not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the market place
2732	engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city
2733	to another are called merchants 
2735	Yes he said 
2736	And there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly
2737	on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength
2738	for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if I do not
2739	mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price
2740	of their labour 
2742	True 
2743	Then hirelings will help to make up our population 
2744	Yes 
2745	And now Adeimantus is our State matured and perfected 
2747	I think so 
2748	Where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part
2749	of the State did they spring up 
2751	Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot
2752	imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
2754	I dare say that you are right in your suggestion I said we had better
2755	think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
2757	Let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life 
2758	now that we have thus established them Will they not produce corn 
2759	and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves 
2760	And when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped
2761	and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod They will
2762	feed on barley meal and flour of wheat baking and kneading them 
2763	making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of
2764	reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds
2765	strewn with yew or myrtle And they and their children will feast 
2766	drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their
2767	heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with
2768	one another And they will take care that their families do not exceed
2769	their means having an eye to poverty or war 
2771	Socrates GLAUCON 
2773	But said Glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to
2774	their meal 
2776	True I replied I had forgotten of course they must have a relish salt 
2777	and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as
2778	country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and
2779	peas and beans and they will roast myrtle berries and acorns at
2780	the fire drinking in moderation And with such a diet they may be
2781	expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath
2782	a similar life to their children after them 
2784	Yes Socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs 
2785	how else would you feed the beasts 
2787	But what would you have Glaucon I replied 
2788	Why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life 
2789	People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and
2790	dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern
2791	style 
2793	Yes I said now I understand the question which you would have me
2794	consider is not only how a State but how a luxurious State is created 
2795	and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a State we shall
2796	be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate In my opinion
2797	the true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I
2798	have described But if you wish also to see a State at fever heat 
2799	I have no objection For I suspect that many will not be satisfied
2800	with the simpler way of way They will be for adding sofas and tables 
2801	and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and
2802	courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every
2803	variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first
2804	speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the
2805	painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold
2806	and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
2808	True he said 
2809	Then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy State is
2810	no longer sufficient Now will the city have to fill and swell with
2811	a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want 
2812	such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class
2813	have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of
2814	music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers 
2815	contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including women s
2816	dresses And we shall want more servants Will not tutors be also
2817	in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well
2818	as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed
2819	and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State but
2820	are needed now They must not be forgotten and there will be animals
2821	of many other kinds if people eat them 
2823	Certainly 
2824	And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians
2825	than before 
2827	Much greater 
2828	And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants
2829	will be too small now and not enough 
2831	Quite true 
2832	Then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture
2833	and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves 
2834	they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the
2835	unlimited accumulation of wealth 
2837	That Socrates will be inevitable 
2838	And so we shall go to war Glaucon Shall we not 
2839	Most certainly he replied 
2840	Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus
2841	much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived
2842	from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States 
2843	private as well as public 
2845	Undoubtedly 
2846	And our State must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing
2847	short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the
2848	invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons
2849	whom we were describing above 
2851	Why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
2853	No I said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged
2854	by all of us when we were framing the State the principle as you
2855	will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
2857	Very true he said 
2858	But is not war an art 
2859	Certainly 
2860	And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
2861	Quite true 
2862	And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver 
2863	a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to
2864	him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was
2865	by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life
2866	long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then
2867	he would become a good workman Now nothing can be more important
2868	than that the work of a soldier should be well done But is war an
2869	art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman 
2870	or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would
2871	be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a
2872	recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to
2873	this and nothing else 
2875	No tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence 
2876	nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and
2877	has never bestowed any attention upon them How then will he who takes
2878	up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in
2879	a day whether with heavy armed or any other kind of troops 
2881	Yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would
2882	be beyond price 
2884	And the higher the duties of the guardian I said the more time 
2885	and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
2887	No doubt he replied 
2888	Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
2890	Certainly 
2891	Then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted
2892	for the task of guarding the city 
2894	It will 
2895	And the selection will be no easy matter I said but we must be brave
2896	and do our best 
2898	We must 
2899	Is not the noble youth very like a well bred dog in respect of guarding
2900	and watching 
2902	What do you mean 
2903	I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake
2904	the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught
2905	him they have to fight with him 
2907	All these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
2909	Well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
2911	Certainly 
2912	And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog
2913	or any other animal Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable
2914	is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature
2915	to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
2917	I have 
2918	Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
2919	required in the guardian 
2921	True 
2922	And also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
2924	Yes 
2925	But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another 
2926	and with everybody else 
2928	A difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
2929	Whereas I said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and
2930	gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without
2931	waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
2933	True he said 
2934	What is to be done then I said how shall we find a gentle nature
2935	which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of
2936	the other 
2938	True 
2939	He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
2940	qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible 
2941	and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
2943	I am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
2944	Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded My
2945	friend I said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have
2946	lost sight of the image which we had before us 
2948	What do you mean he said 
2949	I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite
2950	qualities 
2952	And where do you find them 
2953	Many animals I replied furnish examples of them our friend the
2954	dog is a very good one you know that well bred dogs are perfectly
2955	gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
2957	Yes I know 
2958	Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in
2959	our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
2961	Certainly not 
2962	Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited
2963	nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
2965	I do not apprehend your meaning 
2966	The trait of which I am speaking I replied may be also seen in the
2967	dog and is remarkable in the animal 
2969	What trait 
2970	Why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance 
2971	he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor
2972	the other any good Did this never strike you as curious 
2974	The matter never struck me before but I quite recognise the truth
2975	of your remark 
2977	And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is
2978	a true philosopher 
2980	Why 
2981	Why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy
2982	only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing And must not an
2983	animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes
2984	by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
2986	Most assuredly 
2987	And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
2989	They are the same he replied 
2990	And may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely
2991	to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a
2992	lover of wisdom and knowledge 
2994	That we may safely affirm 
2995	Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State
2996	will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness
2997	and strength 
2999	Undoubtedly 
3000	Then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found
3001	them how are they to be reared and educated Is not this enquiry
3002	which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which
3003	is our final end How do justice and injustice grow up in States 
3004	for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw
3005	out the argument to an inconvenient length 
3007	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
3009	Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
3011	Then I said my dear friend the task must not be given up even
3012	if somewhat long 
3014	Certainly not 
3015	Come then and let us pass a leisure hour in story telling and our
3016	story shall be the education of our heroes 
3018	By all means 
3019	And what shall be their education Can we find a better than the traditional
3020	sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music
3021	for the soul 
3023	True 
3024	Shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
3026	By all means 
3027	And when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
3029	I do 
3030	And literature may be either true or false 
3031	Yes 
3032	And the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the
3033	false 
3035	I do not understand your meaning he said 
3036	You know I said that we begin by telling children stories which 
3037	though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious 
3038	and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn
3039	gymnastics 
3041	Very true 
3042	That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
3044	Quite right he said 
3045	You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any
3046	work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that
3047	is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired
3048	impression is more readily taken 
3050	Quite true 
3051	And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales
3052	which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their
3053	minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we
3054	should wish them to have when they are grown up 
3056	We cannot 
3057	Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers
3058	of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which
3059	is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses
3060	to tell their children the authorised ones only Let them fashion
3061	the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body
3062	with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
3064	Of what tales are you speaking he said 
3065	You may find a model of the lesser in the greater I said for they
3066	are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in
3067	both of them 
3069	Very likely he replied but I do not as yet know what you would term
3070	the greater 
3072	Those I said which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod and the rest
3073	of the poets who have ever been the great story tellers of mankind 
3075	But which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find
3076	with them 
3078	A fault which is most serious I said the fault of telling a lie 
3079	and what is more a bad lie 
3081	But when is this fault committed 
3082	Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods
3083	and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow
3084	of a likeness to the original 
3086	Yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what
3087	are the stories which you mean 
3089	First of all I said there was that greatest of all lies in high
3090	places which the poet told about Uranus and which was a bad lie
3091	too I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did and how Cronus retaliated
3092	on him The doings of Cronus and the sufferings which in turn his
3093	son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not
3094	to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible 
3095	they had better be buried in silence But if there is an absolute
3096	necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery 
3097	and they should sacrifice not a common Eleusinian pig but some
3098	huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will
3099	be very few indeed 
3101	Why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
3103	Yes Adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our State 
3104	the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes
3105	he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises
3106	his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following
3107	the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
3109	I entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are
3110	quite unfit to be repeated 
3112	Neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling
3113	among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said
3114	to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the
3115	gods against one another for they are not true No we shall never
3116	mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments 
3117	and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods
3118	and heroes with their friends and relatives If they would only believe
3119	us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up
3120	to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is
3121	what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when
3122	they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in
3123	a similar spirit But the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his
3124	mother or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking
3125	her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods
3126	in Homer these tales must not be admitted into our State whether
3127	they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not For a young
3128	person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything
3129	that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible
3130	and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales
3131	which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
3133	There you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such
3134	models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall
3135	we answer him 
3137	I said to him You and I Adeimantus at this moment are not poets 
3138	but founders of a State now the founders of a State ought to know
3139	the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the
3140	limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not
3141	their business 
3143	Very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you
3144	mean 
3146	Something of this kind I replied God is always to be represented
3147	as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic 
3148	in which the representation is given 
3150	Right 
3151	And is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
3153	Certainly 
3154	And no good thing is hurtful 
3155	No indeed 
3156	And that which is not hurtful hurts not 
3157	Certainly not 
3158	And that which hurts not does no evil 
3159	No 
3160	And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
3161	Impossible 
3162	And the good is advantageous 
3163	Yes 
3164	And therefore the cause of well being 
3165	Yes 
3166	It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things 
3167	but of the good only 
3169	Assuredly 
3170	Then God if he be good is not the author of all things as the many
3171	assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most
3172	things that occur to men For few are the goods of human life and
3173	many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to God alone 
3174	of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
3176	That appears to me to be most true he said 
3177	Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty
3178	of the folly of saying that two casks Lie at the threshold of Zeus 
3179	full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to
3180	whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune 
3181	at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of
3182	unmingled ill 
3184	Him wild hunger drives o er the beauteous earth And again
3186	Zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us And if any one
3187	asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really
3188	the work of Pandarus was brought about by Athene and Zeus or that
3189	the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and
3190	Zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young
3191	men to hear the words of Aeschylus that God plants guilt among men
3192	when he desires utterly to destroy a house And if a poet writes of
3193	the sufferings of Niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these
3194	iambic verses occur or of the house of Pelops or of the Trojan
3195	war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say
3196	that these are the works of God or if they are of God he must devise
3197	some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that
3198	God did what was just and right and they were the better for being
3199	punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that
3200	God is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted
3201	to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they
3202	require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment
3203	from God but that God being good is the author of evil to any one
3204	is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in
3205	verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any well ordered
3206	commonwealth Such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
3208	I agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the
3209	law 
3211	Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods 
3212	to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that
3213	God is not the author of all things but of good only 
3215	That will do he said 
3216	And what do you think of a second principle Shall I ask you whether
3217	God is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one
3218	shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing
3219	into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
3220	transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his
3221	own proper image 
3223	I cannot answer you he said without more thought 
3224	Well I said but if we suppose a change in anything that change
3225	must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
3227	Most certainly 
3228	And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered
3229	or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human
3230	frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the
3231	plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds
3232	or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
3234	Of course 
3235	And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged
3236	by any external influence 
3238	True 
3239	And the same principle as I should suppose applies to all composite
3240	things furniture houses garments when good and well made they
3241	are least altered by time and circumstances 
3243	Very true 
3244	Then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both 
3245	is least liable to suffer change from without 
3247	True 
3248	But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect 
3250	Of course they are 
3251	Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many
3252	shapes 
3254	He cannot 
3255	But may he not change and transform himself 
3256	Clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
3258	And will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for
3259	the worse and more unsightly 
3261	If he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot
3262	suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
3264	Very true Adeimantus but then would any one whether God or man 
3265	desire to make himself worse 
3267	Impossible 
3268	Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change being 
3269	as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god
3270	remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
3272	That necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
3273	Then I said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that
3275	The gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk
3276	up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander Proteus
3277	and Thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other
3278	kind of poetry introduce Here disguised in the likeness of a priestess
3279	asking an alms 
3281	For the life giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos let
3282	us have no more lies of that sort Neither must we have mothers under
3283	the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version
3284	of these myths telling how certain gods as they say Go about
3285	by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms 
3286	but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and
3287	at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
3289	Heaven forbid he said 
3290	But although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft
3291	and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
3293	Perhaps he replied 
3294	Well but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie whether
3295	in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
3297	I cannot say he replied 
3298	Do you not know I said that the true lie if such an expression
3299	may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
3301	What do you mean he said 
3302	I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest
3303	and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters 
3304	there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of
3305	him 
3307	Still he said I do not comprehend you 
3308	The reason is I replied that you attribute some profound meaning
3309	to my words but I am only saying that deception or being deceived
3310	or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves 
3311	which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the
3312	lie is what mankind least like that I say is what they utterly
3313	detest 
3315	There is nothing more hateful to them 
3316	And as I was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him
3317	who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is
3318	only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection
3319	of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood Am I not right 
3321	Perfectly right 
3322	The true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
3324	Yes 
3325	Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful 
3326	in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when
3327	those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are
3328	going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine
3329	or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just
3330	now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times 
3331	we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to
3332	account 
3334	Very true he said 
3335	But can any of these reasons apply to God Can we suppose that he
3336	is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
3338	That would be ridiculous he said 
3339	Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God 
3340	I should say not 
3341	Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
3343	That is inconceivable 
3344	But he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
3345	But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God 
3346	Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie 
3347	None whatever 
3348	Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
3350	Yes 
3351	Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes
3352	not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
3354	Your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
3355	You agree with me then I said that this is the second type or form
3356	in which we should write and speak about divine things The gods are
3357	not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind
3358	in any way 
3360	I grant that 
3361	Then although we are admirers of Homer we do not admire the lying
3362	dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon neither will we praise the verses
3363	of Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials
3365	Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long 
3366	and to know no sickness And when he had spoken of my lot as in all
3367	things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my
3368	soul And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full
3369	of prophecy would not fail And now he himself who uttered the strain 
3370	he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who
3371	has slain my son 
3373	These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse
3374	our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither
3375	shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of
3376	the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can
3377	be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
3379	I entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make
3380	them my laws 
3382	 
3384	BOOK III
3386	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
3388	Such then I said are our principles of theology some tales are
3389	to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their
3390	youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents 
3391	and to value friendship with one another 
3393	Yes and I think that our principles are right he said 
3395	But if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons
3396	besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear
3397	of death Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
3399	Certainly not he said 
3400	And can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle
3401	rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be
3402	real and terrible 
3404	Impossible 
3405	Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of
3406	tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather
3407	to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions
3408	are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
3410	That will be our duty he said 
3411	Then I said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages 
3412	beginning with the verses 
3414	I would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man
3415	than rule over all the dead who have come to nought We must also
3416	expunge the verse which tells us how Pluto feared 
3418	Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he
3419	seen both of mortals and immortals And again 
3421	O heavens verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly
3422	form but no mind at all Again of Tiresias 
3424	 To him even after death did Persephone grant mind that he alone
3425	should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades Again 
3427	The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades lamentng her fate 
3428	leaving manhood and youth Again 
3430	And the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth 
3431	And 
3433	As bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped
3434	out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling
3435	to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they
3436	moved And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if
3437	we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical 
3438	or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical
3439	charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men
3440	who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
3442	Undoubtedly 
3443	Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names
3444	describe the world below Cocytus and Styx ghosts under the earth 
3445	and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention
3446	causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears
3447	them I do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use
3448	of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians
3449	may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
3451	There is a real danger he said 
3452	Then we must have no more of them 
3453	True 
3454	Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
3456	Clearly 
3457	And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
3458	men 
3460	They will go with the rest 
3461	But shall we be right in getting rid of them Reflect our principle
3462	is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other
3463	good man who is his comrade 
3465	Yes that is our principle 
3466	And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though
3467	he had suffered anything terrible 
3469	He will not 
3470	Such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and
3471	his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
3473	True he said 
3474	And for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation
3475	of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
3477	Assuredly 
3478	And therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with
3479	the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall
3480	him 
3482	Yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
3484	Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous
3485	men and making them over to women and not even to women who are
3486	good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are
3487	being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn
3488	to do the like 
3490	That will be very right 
3491	Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict
3492	Achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then
3493	on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in
3494	a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty
3495	ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping
3496	and wailing in the various modes which Homer has delineated Nor should
3497	he describe Priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
3499	Rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name Still more
3500	earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods
3501	lamenting and saying 
3503	Alas my misery Alas that I bore the harvest to my sorrow But if
3504	he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely
3505	to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
3507	O heavens with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased
3508	round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful Or again 
3510	Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon dearest of men to me 
3511	subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius For if my
3512	sweet Adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations
3513	of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will
3514	any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured
3515	by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may
3516	arise in his mind to say and do the like And instead of having any
3517	shame or self control he will be always whining and lamenting on
3518	slight occasions 
3520	Yes he said that is most true 
3521	Yes I replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument
3522	has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is
3523	disproved by a better 
3525	It ought not to be 
3526	Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter For a fit of
3527	laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces
3528	a violent reaction 
3530	So I believe 
3531	Then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented
3532	as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation
3533	of the gods be allowed 
3535	Still less of the gods as you say he replied 
3536	Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods
3537	as that of Homer when he describes how 
3539	Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they
3540	saw Hephaestus bustling about the mansion On your views we must
3541	not admit them 
3543	On my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit
3544	them is certain 
3546	Again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie
3547	is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then
3548	the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private
3549	individuals have no business with them 
3551	Clearly not he said 
3552	Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers
3553	of the State should be the persons and they in their dealings either
3554	with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for
3555	the public good But nobody else should meddle with anything of the
3556	kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man
3557	to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than
3558	for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth
3559	about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer 
3560	or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the
3561	ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself
3562	or his fellow sailors 
3564	Most true he said 
3565	If then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State 
3567	Any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter 
3568	he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive
3569	and destructive of ship or State 
3571	Most certainly he said if our idea of the State is ever carried
3572	out 
3574	In the next place our youth must be temperate 
3575	Certainly 
3576	Are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience
3577	to commanders and self control in sensual pleasures 
3579	True 
3580	Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer 
3582	Friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
3584	The Greeks marched breathing prowess 
3585	 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same
3586	kind 
3588	We shall 
3589	What of this line 
3591	O heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag 
3592	and of the words which follow Would you say that these or any similar
3593	impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to
3594	their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
3596	They are ill spoken 
3597	They may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce
3598	to temperance And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young
3599	men you would agree with me there 
3601	Yes 
3602	And then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his
3603	opinion is more glorious than 
3605	When the tables are full of bread and meat and the cup bearer carries
3606	round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is
3607	it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words 
3608	Or the verse 
3610	The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger What
3611	would you say again to the tale of Zeus who while other gods and
3612	men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans 
3613	but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely
3614	overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut 
3615	but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never
3616	been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one
3617	another 
3619	Without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how
3620	Hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around Ares
3621	and Aphrodite 
3623	Indeed he said I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear
3624	that sort of thing 
3626	But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these
3627	they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
3629	He smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
3630	Endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
3632	Certainly he said 
3633	In the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers
3634	of money 
3636	Certainly not 
3637	Neither must we sing to them of 
3639	Gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings Neither is Phoenix 
3640	the tutor of Achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his
3641	pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts
3642	of the Greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not
3643	lay aside his anger Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles
3644	himself to have been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon s
3645	or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of
3646	Hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
3648	Undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
3650	Loving Homer as I do I hardly like to say that in attributing these
3651	feelings to Achilles or in believing that they are truly to him 
3652	he is guilty of downright impiety As little can I believe the narrative
3653	of his insolence to Apollo where he says 
3655	Thou hast wronged me O far darter most abominable of deities Verily
3656	I would he even with thee if I had only the power or his insubordination
3657	to the river god on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his
3658	offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair which had been previously
3659	dedicated to the other river god Spercheius and that he actually
3660	performed this vow or that he dragged Hector round the tomb of Patroclus 
3661	and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this I cannot believe
3662	that he was guilty any more than I can allow our citizens to believe
3663	that he the wise Cheiron s pupil the son of a goddess and of Peleus
3664	who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from Zeus was so
3665	disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly
3666	inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined
3667	with overweening contempt of gods and men 
3669	You are quite right he replied 
3670	And let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the
3671	tale of Theseus son of Poseidon or of Peirithous son of Zeus going
3672	forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero
3673	or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they
3674	falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the
3675	poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or
3676	that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they
3677	shall not be permitted to affirm We will not have them trying to
3678	persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that
3679	heroes are no better than men sentiments which as we were saying 
3680	are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot
3681	come from the gods 
3683	Assuredly not 
3684	And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear
3685	them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is
3686	convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by
3687	 
3689	The kindred of the gods the relatives of Zeus whose ancestral altar 
3690	the attar of Zeus is aloft in air on the peak of Ida and who have
3692	the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins And therefore let
3693	us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among
3694	the young 
3696	By all means he replied 
3697	But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are
3698	not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us 
3699	The manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below
3700	should be treated has been already laid down 
3702	Very true 
3703	And what shall we say about men That is clearly the remaining portion
3704	of our subject 
3706	Clearly so 
3707	But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present 
3708	my friend 
3710	Why not 
3711	Because if I am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men
3712	poets and story tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements
3713	when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable 
3714	and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice
3715	is a man s own loss and another s gain these things we shall forbid
3716	them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
3718	To be sure we shall he replied 
3719	But if you admit that I am right in this then I shall maintain that
3720	you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
3722	I grant the truth of your inference 
3723	That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question
3724	which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is 
3725	and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems
3726	to be just or not 
3728	Most true he said 
3729	Enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and
3730	when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been
3731	completely treated 
3733	I do not understand what you mean said Adeimantus 
3734	Then I must make you understand and perhaps I may be more intelligible
3735	if I put the matter in this way You are aware I suppose that all
3736	mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present 
3737	or to come 
3739	Certainly he replied 
3740	And narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union
3741	of the two 
3743	That again he said I do not quite understand 
3744	I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty
3745	in making myself apprehended Like a bad speaker therefore I will
3746	not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration
3747	of my meaning You know the first lines of the Iliad in which the
3748	poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter and
3749	that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon Chryses failing
3750	of his object invoked the anger of the God against the Achaeans 
3751	Now as far as these lines 
3753	And he prayed all the Greeks but especially the two sons of Atreus 
3754	the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person 
3755	he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else But in what
3756	follows he takes the person of Chryses and then he does all that
3757	he can to make us believe that the speaker is not Homer but the aged
3758	priest himself And in this double form he has cast the entire narrative
3759	of the events which occurred at Troy and in Ithaca and throughout
3760	the Odyssey 
3762	Yes 
3763	And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites
3764	from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
3766	Quite true 
3767	But when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say
3768	that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs
3769	you is going to speak 
3771	Certainly 
3772	And this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of
3773	voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he
3774	assumes 
3776	Of course 
3777	Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed
3778	by way of imitation 
3780	Very true 
3781	Or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then
3782	again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration 
3783	However in order that I may make my meaning quite clear and that
3784	you may no more say I don t understand I will show how the change
3785	might be effected If Homer had said The priest came having his
3786	daughter s ransom in his hands supplicating the Achaeans and above
3787	all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of
3788	Chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have
3789	been not imitation but simple narration The passage would have
3790	run as follows I am no poet and therefore I drop the metre The
3791	priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they
3792	might capture Troy and return safely home but begged that they would
3793	give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought 
3794	and respect the God Thus he spoke and the other Greeks revered the
3795	priest and assented But Agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart
3796	and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the God should
3797	be of no avail to him the daughter of Chryses should not be released 
3798	he said she should grow old with him in Argos And then he told
3799	him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home
3800	unscathed And the old man went away in fear and silence and when
3801	he had left the camp he called upon Apollo by his many names reminding
3802	him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building
3803	his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds
3804	might be returned to him and that the Achaeans might expiate his
3805	tears by the arrows of the god and so on In this way the whole
3806	becomes simple narrative 
3808	I understand he said 
3809	Or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages
3810	are omitted and the dialogue only left 
3812	That also he said I understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
3814	You have conceived my meaning perfectly and if I mistake not what
3815	you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry
3816	and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of
3817	this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite
3818	style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb
3819	affords the best example and the combination of both is found in
3820	epic and in several other styles of poetry Do I take you with me 
3822	Yes he said I see now what you meant 
3823	I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying that we had
3824	done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
3826	Yes I remember 
3827	In saying this I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding
3828	about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories 
3829	are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or
3830	in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation
3831	be prohibited 
3833	You mean I suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted
3834	into our State 
3836	Yes I said but there may be more than this in question I really
3837	do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we
3838	go 
3840	And go we will he said 
3841	Then Adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
3842	imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule
3843	already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not
3844	many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining
3845	much reputation in any 
3847	Certainly 
3848	And this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many
3849	things as well as he would imitate a single one 
3851	He cannot 
3852	Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in
3853	life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other
3854	parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied 
3855	the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers
3856	of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
3858	Yes I did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot
3859	succeed in both 
3861	Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
3863	True 
3864	Neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things
3865	are but imitations 
3867	They are so 
3868	And human nature Adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet
3869	smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well 
3870	as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
3872	Quite true he replied 
3873	If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our
3874	guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves
3875	wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State making this their
3876	craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they
3877	ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at
3878	all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which
3879	are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy 
3880	free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating
3881	any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should
3882	come to be what they imitate Did you never observe how imitations 
3883	beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow
3884	into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and
3885	mind 
3887	Yes certainly he said 
3888	Then I said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and
3889	of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman 
3890	whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and
3891	vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she
3892	is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who
3893	is in sickness love or labour 
3895	Very right he said 
3896	Neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the
3897	offices of slaves 
3899	They must not 
3900	And surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the
3901	reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or
3902	revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other
3903	manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed 
3904	as the manner of such is Neither should they be trained to imitate
3905	the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness 
3906	like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
3908	Very true he replied 
3909	Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or
3910	boatswains or the like 
3912	How can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds
3913	to the callings of any of these 
3915	Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls 
3916	the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that
3917	sort of thing 
3919	Nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour
3920	of madmen 
3922	You mean I said if I understand you aright that there is one sort
3923	of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when
3924	he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man
3925	of an opposite character and education 
3927	And which are these two sorts he asked 
3928	Suppose I answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration
3929	comes on some saying or action of another good man I should imagine
3930	that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this
3931	sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good
3932	man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he
3933	is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other
3934	disaster But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him 
3935	he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and
3936	will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is
3937	performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to
3938	play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion
3939	and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment
3940	of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts
3941	at it 
3943	So I should expect he replied 
3944	Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated
3945	out of Homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and
3946	narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great
3947	deal of the latter Do you agree 
3949	Certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily
3950	take 
3952	But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything 
3953	and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will
3954	be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not
3955	as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company 
3956	As I was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of
3957	thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and
3958	pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all
3959	sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep 
3960	or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice
3961	and gesture and there will be very little narration 
3963	That he said will be his mode of speaking 
3964	These then are the two kinds of style 
3965	Yes 
3966	And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and
3967	has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen
3968	for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks
3969	correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep
3970	within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great 
3971	and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
3973	That is quite true he said 
3974	Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
3975	rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the
3976	style has all sorts of changes 
3978	That is also perfectly true he replied 
3979	And do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all
3980	poetry and every form of expression in words No one can say anything
3981	except in one or other of them or in both together 
3983	They include all he said 
3984	And shall we receive into our State all the three styles or one only
3985	of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
3987	I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
3989	Yes I said Adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming 
3990	and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen
3991	by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants 
3992	and with the world in general 
3994	I do not deny it 
3995	But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our
3996	State in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man
3997	plays one part only 
3999	Yes quite unsuitable 
4000	And this is the reason why in our State and in our State only we
4001	shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and
4002	a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier
4003	a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
4005	True he said 
4006	And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are
4007	so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a
4008	proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and
4009	worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also
4010	inform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to exist 
4011	the law will not allow them And so when we have anointed him with
4012	myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him
4013	away to another city For we mean to employ for our souls health
4014	the rougher and severer poet or story teller who will imitate the
4015	style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we
4016	prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
4018	We certainly will he said if we have the power 
4019	Then now my friend I said that part of music or literary education
4020	which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished 
4021	for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
4023	I think so too he said 
4024	Next in order will follow melody and song 
4025	That is obvious 
4026	Every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are
4027	to be consistent with ourselves 
4029	Socrates GLAUCON 
4031	I fear said Glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly
4032	includes me for I cannot at the moment say what they should be though
4033	I may guess 
4035	At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the
4036	words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge I may
4037	presuppose 
4039	Yes he said so much as that you may 
4040	And as for the words there surely be no difference words between
4041	words which are and which are not set to music both will conform
4042	to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
4044	Yes 
4045	And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
4046	Certainly 
4047	We were saying when we spoke of the subject matter that we had no
4048	need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
4050	True 
4051	And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow You are musical 
4052	and can tell me 
4054	The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian and the
4055	full toned or bass Lydian and such like 
4057	These then I said must be banished even to women who have a character
4058	to maintain they are of no use and much less to men Certainly 
4060	In the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
4061	unbecoming the character of our guardians 
4063	Utterly unbecoming 
4064	And which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
4065	The Ionian he replied and the Lydian they are termed relaxed 
4067	Well and are these of any military use 
4068	Quite the reverse he replied and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian
4069	are the only ones which you have left 
4071	I answered Of the harmonies I know nothing but I want to have one
4072	warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the
4073	hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and
4074	he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil 
4075	and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step
4076	and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times
4077	of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity 
4078	and he is seeking to persuade God by prayer or man by instruction
4079	and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness
4080	to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents
4081	him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away
4082	by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances 
4083	and acquiescing in the event These two harmonies I ask you to leave 
4084	the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the
4085	unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage 
4086	and the strain of temperance these I say leave 
4088	And these he replied are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which
4089	I was just now speaking 
4091	Then I said if these and these only are to be used in our songs
4092	and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic
4093	scale 
4095	I suppose not 
4096	Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners
4097	and complex scales or the makers of any other many stringed curiously harmonised
4098	instruments 
4100	Certainly not 
4101	But what do you say to flute makers and flute players Would you admit
4102	them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of
4103	harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together 
4104	even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
4106	Clearly not 
4107	There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city 
4108	and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
4110	That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
4112	The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his instruments
4113	is not at all strange I said 
4115	Not at all he replied 
4116	And so by the dog of Egypt we have been unconsciously purging the
4117	State which not long ago we termed luxurious 
4119	And we have done wisely he replied 
4120	Then let us now finish the purgation I said Next in order to harmonies 
4121	rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same
4122	rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres
4123	of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions
4124	of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them 
4125	we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit 
4126	not the words to the foot and melody To say what these rhythms are
4127	will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught
4128	me the harmonies 
4130	But indeed he replied I cannot tell you I only know that there
4131	are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems
4132	are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all
4133	the harmonies are composed that is an observation which I have made 
4134	But of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations I am unable
4135	to say 
4137	Then I said we must take Damon into our counsels and he will tell
4138	us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury 
4139	or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression
4140	of opposite feelings And I think that I have an indistinct recollection
4141	of his mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic 
4142	and he arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand 
4143	making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and
4144	short alternating and unless I am mistaken he spoke of an iambic
4145	as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long
4146	quantities Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the
4147	movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination
4148	of the two for I am not certain what he meant These matters however 
4149	as I was saying had better be referred to Damon himself for the
4150	analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
4152	Rather so I should say 
4153	But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of
4154	grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
4156	None at all 
4157	And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and
4158	bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style 
4159	for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the
4160	words and not the words by them 
4162	Just so he said they should follow the words 
4163	And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the
4164	temper of the soul 
4166	Yes 
4167	And everything else on the style 
4168	Yes 
4169	Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend
4170	on simplicity I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly
4171	ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only
4172	an euphemism for folly 
4174	Very true he replied 
4175	And if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make
4176	these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
4178	They must 
4179	And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive
4180	art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every
4181	kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of
4182	them there is grace or the absence of grace And ugliness and discord
4183	and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature 
4184	as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and
4185	bear their likeness 
4187	That is quite true he said 
4188	But shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only
4189	to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works 
4190	on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our State Or
4191	is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they
4192	also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and
4193	intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building
4194	and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this
4195	rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State 
4196	lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him We would not have
4197	our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious
4198	pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower
4199	day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering
4200	mass of corruption in their own soul Let our artists rather be those
4201	who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful 
4202	then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and
4203	sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence
4204	of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a health giving
4205	breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest
4206	years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
4208	There can be no nobler training than that he replied 
4209	And therefore I said Glaucon musical training is a more potent
4210	instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way
4211	into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten 
4212	imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated
4213	graceful or of him who is ill educated ungraceful and also because
4214	he who has received this true education of the inner being will most
4215	shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with
4216	a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into
4217	his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame
4218	and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is
4219	able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise
4220	and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
4222	Yes he said I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should
4223	be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
4225	Just as in learning to read I said we were satisfied when we knew
4226	the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring
4227	sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether
4228	they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them
4229	out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until
4230	we recognise them wherever they are found 
4232	True 
4233	Or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in
4234	a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and
4235	study giving us the knowledge of both 
4237	Exactly 
4238	Even so as I maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have
4239	to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential
4240	forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their
4241	images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small
4242	things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of
4243	one art and study 
4245	Most assuredly 
4246	And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the
4247	two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him
4248	who has an eye to see it 
4250	The fairest indeed 
4251	And the fairest is also the loveliest 
4252	That may be assumed 
4253	And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with
4254	the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious
4255	soul 
4257	That is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if
4258	there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of
4259	it and will love all the same 
4261	I perceive I said that you have or have had experiences of this
4262	sort and I agree But let me ask you another question Has excess
4263	of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
4265	How can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of
4266	his faculties quite as much as pain 
4268	Or any affinity to virtue in general 
4269	None whatever 
4270	Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
4271	Yes the greatest 
4272	And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
4274	No nor a madder 
4275	Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
4277	Quite true he said 
4278	Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true
4279	love 
4281	Certainly not 
4282	Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near
4283	the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it
4284	if their love is of the right sort 
4286	No indeed Socrates it must never come near them 
4287	Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make
4288	a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity
4289	to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for
4290	a noble purpose and he must first have the other s consent and this
4291	rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be
4292	seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of
4293	coarseness and bad taste 
4295	I quite agree he said 
4296	Thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be
4297	the end of music if not the love of beauty 
4299	I agree he said 
4300	After music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
4302	Certainly 
4303	Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training
4304	in it should be careful and should continue through life Now my belief
4305	is and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion
4306	in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good
4307	body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary 
4308	that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far
4309	as this may be possible What do you say 
4311	Yes I agree 
4312	Then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing
4313	over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity
4314	we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
4316	Very good 
4317	That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked
4318	by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk
4319	and not know where in the world he is 
4321	Yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take
4322	care of him is ridiculous indeed 
4324	But next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training
4325	for the great contest of all are they not 
4327	Yes he said 
4328	And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
4330	Why not 
4331	I am afraid I said that a habit of body such as they have is but
4332	a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health Do you not
4333	observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable
4334	to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree 
4335	from their customary regimen 
4337	Yes I do 
4338	Then I said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior
4339	athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with
4340	the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food 
4341	of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when
4342	on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
4344	That is my view 
4345	The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music
4346	which we were just now describing 
4348	How so 
4349	Why I conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is
4350	simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
4352	What do you mean 
4353	My meaning may be learned from Homer he you know feeds his heroes
4354	at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they
4355	have no fish although they are on the shores of the Hellespont and
4356	they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food
4357	most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light
4358	a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
4360	True 
4361	And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere
4362	mentioned in Homer In proscribing them however he is not singular 
4363	all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in
4364	good condition should take nothing of the kind 
4366	Yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking
4367	them 
4369	Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners and the refinements
4370	of Sicilian cookery 
4372	I think not 
4373	Nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a
4374	Corinthian girl as his fair friend 
4376	Certainly not 
4377	Neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought 
4378	of Athenian confectionery 
4380	Certainly not 
4381	All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody
4382	and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms 
4383	Exactly 
4385	There complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity
4386	in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity
4387	in gymnastic of health in the body 
4389	Most true he said 
4390	But when intemperance and disease multiply in a State halls of justice
4391	and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and
4392	the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest
4393	which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
4395	Of course 
4396	And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state
4397	of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort
4398	of people need the skill of first rate physicians and judges but
4399	also those who would profess to have had a liberal education Is it
4400	not disgraceful and a great sign of want of good breeding that a
4401	man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has
4402	none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into
4403	the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
4405	Of all things he said the most disgraceful 
4406	Would you say most I replied when you consider that there is a
4407	further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life long litigant 
4408	passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant 
4409	but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness 
4410	he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every
4411	crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like
4412	a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in
4413	order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that
4414	so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is
4415	a far higher and nobler sort of thing Is not that still more disgraceful 
4417	Yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
4418	Well I said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound
4419	has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because 
4420	by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing 
4421	men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were
4422	a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names
4423	for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a
4424	disgrace 
4426	Yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names
4427	to diseases 
4429	Yes I said and I do not believe that there were any such diseases
4430	in the days of Asclepius and this I infer from the circumstance that
4431	the hero Eurypylus after he has been wounded in Homer drinks a posset
4432	of Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley meal and grated cheese 
4433	which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of Asclepius who
4434	were at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink 
4435	or rebuke Patroclus who is treating his case 
4437	Well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given
4438	to a person in his condition 
4440	Not so extraordinary I replied if you bear in mind that in former
4441	days as is commonly said before the time of Herodicus the guild
4442	of Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which
4443	may be said to educate diseases But Herodicus being a trainer and
4444	himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and
4445	doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself 
4446	and secondly the rest of the world 
4448	How was that he said 
4449	By the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which
4450	he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he
4451	passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but
4452	attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed
4453	in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help
4454	of science he struggled on to old age 
4456	A rare reward of his skill 
4457	Yes I said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood
4458	that if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian
4459	arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such
4460	a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all well ordered
4461	states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend 
4462	and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill This
4463	we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do
4464	not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
4466	How do you mean he said 
4467	I mean this When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough
4468	and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these
4469	are his remedies And if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics 
4470	and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that
4471	sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and
4472	that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease
4473	to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding
4474	good bye to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits 
4475	and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution
4476	falls he dies and has no more trouble 
4478	Yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the
4479	art of medicine thus far only 
4481	Has he not I said an occupation and what profit would there be
4482	in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
4484	Quite true he said 
4485	But with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that
4486	he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would
4487	live 
4489	He is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
4490	Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides that as soon as
4491	a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
4493	Nay he said I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
4495	Let us not have a dispute with him about this I said but rather
4496	ask ourselves Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man 
4497	or can he live without it And if obligatory on him then let us raise
4498	a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an
4499	impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the
4500	mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment
4501	of Phocylides 
4503	Of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of
4504	the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical
4505	to the practice of virtue 
4507	Yes indeed I replied and equally incompatible with the management
4508	of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important
4509	of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or self reflection
4510	 there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to
4511	be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial
4512	of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is
4513	always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety
4514	about the state of his body 
4516	Yes likely enough 
4517	And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited
4518	the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy
4519	constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these
4520	he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein
4521	consulting the interests of the State but bodies which disease had
4522	penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure
4523	by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to
4524	lengthen out good for nothing lives or to have weak fathers begetting
4525	weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he
4526	had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no
4527	use either to himself or to the State 
4529	Then he said you regard Asclepius as a statesman 
4530	Clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons Note
4531	that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines
4532	of which I am speaking at the siege of Troy You will remember how 
4533	when Pandarus wounded Menelaus they 
4535	Sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies 
4536	but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or
4537	drink in the case of Menelaus any more than in the case of Eurypylus 
4538	the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before
4539	he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though
4540	he did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine he might get well
4541	all the same But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and
4542	intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves
4543	or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and
4544	though they were as rich as Midas the sons of Asclepius would have
4545	declined to attend them 
4547	They were very acute persons those sons of Asclepius 
4548	Naturally so I replied Nevertheless the tragedians and Pindar disobeying
4549	our behests although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the son
4550	of Apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who
4551	was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning 
4552	But we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will
4553	not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a
4554	god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious
4555	he was not the son of a god 
4557	All that Socrates is excellent but I should like to put a question
4558	to you Ought there not to be good physicians in a State and are
4559	not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions
4560	good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who
4561	are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
4563	Yes I said I too would have good judges and good physicians But
4564	do you know whom I think good 
4566	Will you tell me 
4567	I will if I can Let me however note that in the same question you
4568	join two things which are not the same 
4570	How so he asked 
4571	Why I said you join physicians and judges Now the most skilful
4572	physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined
4573	with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease 
4574	they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner
4575	of diseases in their own persons For the body as I conceive is
4576	not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we
4577	could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure
4578	the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick
4579	can cure nothing 
4581	That is very true he said 
4582	But with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind 
4583	he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and
4584	to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone
4585	through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly
4586	infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from
4587	his own self consciousness the honourable mind which is to form a
4588	healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of
4589	evil habits when young And this is the reason why in youth good men
4590	often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest 
4591	because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
4593	Yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
4594	Therefore I said the judge should not be young he should have learned
4595	to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation
4596	of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not
4597	personal experience 
4599	Yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
4600	Yes I replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your
4601	question for he is good who has a good soul But the cunning and
4602	suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes 
4603	and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst
4604	his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because
4605	he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of
4606	men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a
4607	fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise
4608	an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at
4609	the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he
4610	meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought
4611	to be rather wise than foolish 
4613	Most true he said 
4614	Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man 
4615	but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature 
4616	educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice 
4617	the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
4619	And in mine also 
4620	This is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you
4621	sanction in your State They will minister to better natures giving
4622	health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their
4623	bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls
4624	they will put an end to themselves 
4626	That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State 
4628	And thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music
4629	which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to
4630	law 
4632	Clearly 
4633	And the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise
4634	the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless
4635	in some extreme case 
4637	That I quite believe 
4638	The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate
4639	the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength 
4640	he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop
4641	his muscles 
4643	Very right he said 
4644	Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as
4645	is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other
4646	fir the training of the body 
4648	What then is the real object of them 
4649	I believe I said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly
4650	the improvement of the soul 
4652	How can that be he asked 
4653	Did you never observe I said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive
4654	devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion
4655	to music 
4657	In what way shown he said 
4658	The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of
4659	softness and effeminacy I replied 
4661	Yes he said I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much
4662	of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond
4663	what is good for him 
4665	Yet surely I said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if
4666	rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified 
4667	is liable to become hard and brutal 
4669	That I quite think 
4670	On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness 
4671	And this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but 
4672	if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
4674	True 
4675	And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
4677	Assuredly 
4678	And both should be in harmony 
4679	Beyond question 
4680	And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
4682	Yes 
4683	And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
4684	Very true 
4685	And when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his
4686	soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy
4687	airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed
4688	in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process
4689	the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made
4690	useful instead of brittle and useless But if he carries on the
4691	softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt
4692	and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews
4693	of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
4695	Very true 
4696	If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily
4697	accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music
4698	weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation
4699	he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having
4700	spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
4702	Exactly 
4703	And so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
4704	feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy 
4705	at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit 
4706	and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
4708	Certainly 
4709	And what happens if he do nothing else and holds no con a verse
4710	with the Muses does not even that intelligence which there may be
4711	in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought
4712	or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking
4713	up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their
4714	mists 
4716	True he said 
4717	And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never
4718	using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence
4719	and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in
4720	all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and
4721	grace 
4723	That is quite true he said 
4724	And as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited
4725	and the other the philosophical some God as I should say has given
4726	mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul
4727	and body in order that these two principles like the strings of
4728	an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly
4729	harmonised 
4731	That appears to be the intention 
4732	And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions 
4733	and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true
4734	musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the
4735	strings 
4737	You are quite right Socrates 
4738	And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if
4739	the government is to last 
4741	Yes he will be absolutely necessary 
4742	Such then are our principles of nurture and education Where would
4743	be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens 
4744	or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian
4745	contests For these all follow the general principle and having found
4746	that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
4748	I dare say that there will be no difficulty 
4749	Very good I said then what is the next question Must we not ask
4750	who are to be rulers and who subjects 
4752	Certainly 
4753	There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
4755	Clearly 
4756	And that the best of these must rule 
4757	That is also clear 
4758	Now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
4760	Yes 
4761	And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they
4762	not be those who have most the character of guardians 
4764	Yes 
4765	And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a
4766	special care of the State 
4768	True 
4769	And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
4771	To be sure 
4772	And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having
4773	the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil
4774	fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
4776	Very true he replied 
4777	Then there must be a selection Let us note among the guardians those
4778	who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is
4779	for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what
4780	is against her interests 
4782	Those are the right men 
4783	And they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may
4784	see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence
4785	either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of
4786	duty to the State 
4788	How cast off he said 
4789	I will explain to you I replied A resolution may go out of a man s
4790	mind either with his will or against his will with his will when
4791	he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever
4792	he is deprived of a truth 
4794	I understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning
4795	of the unwilling I have yet to learn 
4797	Why I said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good 
4798	and willingly of evil Is not to have lost the truth an evil and
4799	to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive
4800	things as they are is to possess the truth 
4802	Yes he replied I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived
4803	of truth against their will 
4805	And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or
4806	force or enchantment 
4808	Still he replied I do not understand you 
4809	I fear that I must have been talking darkly like the tragedians 
4810	I only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others
4811	forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of
4812	the other and this I call theft Now you understand me 
4814	Yes 
4815	Those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain
4816	or grief compels to change their opinion 
4818	I understand he said and you are quite right 
4819	And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
4820	their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the
4821	sterner influence of fear 
4823	Yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
4825	Therefore as I was just now saying we must enquire who are the best
4826	guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
4827	of the State is to be the rule of their lives We must watch them
4828	from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they
4829	are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers
4830	and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial
4831	is to be rejected That will be the way 
4833	Yes 
4834	And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed
4835	for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the
4836	same qualities 
4838	Very right he replied 
4839	And then I said we must try them with enchantments that is the third
4840	sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who
4841	take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature 
4842	so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass
4843	them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved
4844	in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against
4845	all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of
4846	themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining
4847	under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as
4848	will be most serviceable to the individual and to the State And he
4849	who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out
4850	of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian
4851	of the State he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive
4852	sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have
4853	to give But him who fails we must reject I am inclined to think
4854	that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should
4855	be chosen and appointed I speak generally and not with any pretension
4856	to exactness 
4858	And speaking generally I agree with you he said 
4859	And perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied
4860	to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies
4861	and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not
4862	have the will or the others the power to harm us The young men
4863	whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries
4864	and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
4866	I agree with you he said 
4867	How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we
4868	lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if
4869	that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
4871	What sort of lie he said 
4872	Nothing new I replied only an old Phoenician tale of what has often
4873	occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made
4874	the world believe though not in our time and I do not know whether
4875	such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable 
4876	if it did 
4878	How your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
4879	You will not wonder I replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
4881	Speak he said and fear not 
4882	Well then I will speak although I really know not how to look you
4883	in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which
4884	I propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the
4885	soldiers and lastly to the people They are to be told that their
4886	youth was a dream and the education and training which they received
4887	from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they
4888	were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves
4889	and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were
4890	completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country
4891	being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise
4892	for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens
4893	they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
4895	You had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were
4896	going to tell 
4898	True I replied but there is more coming I have only told you half 
4899	Citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet
4900	God has framed you differently Some of you have the power of command 
4901	and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also
4902	they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be
4903	auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he
4904	has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be
4905	preserved in the children But as all are of the same original stock 
4906	a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent
4907	a golden son And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers 
4908	and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously
4909	guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity
4910	of the race They should observe what elements mingle in their off
4911	spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture
4912	of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and
4913	the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because
4914	he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan 
4915	just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold
4916	or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries 
4917	For an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State 
4918	it will be destroyed Such is the tale is there any possibility of
4919	making our citizens believe in it 
4921	Not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing
4922	this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their
4923	sons sons and posterity after them 
4925	I see the difficulty I replied yet the fostering of such a belief
4926	will make them care more for the city and for one another Enough 
4927	however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of
4928	rumour while we arm our earth born heroes and lead them forth under
4929	the command of their rulers Let them look round and select a spot
4930	whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory
4931	within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves
4932	may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and
4933	when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper Gods and
4934	prepare their dwellings 
4936	Just so he said 
4937	And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold
4938	of winter and the heat of summer 
4940	I suppose that you mean houses he replied 
4941	Yes I said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of shop keepers 
4943	What is the difference he said 
4944	That I will endeavour to explain I replied To keep watchdogs who 
4945	from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit
4946	or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not
4947	like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
4949	Truly monstrous he said 
4950	And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being
4951	stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and
4952	become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
4954	Yes great care should be taken 
4955	And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
4957	But they are well educated already he replied 
4958	I cannot be so confident my dear Glaucon I said I am much certain
4959	that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may
4960	be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them
4961	in their relations to one another and to those who are under their
4962	protection 
4964	Very true he replied 
4965	And not only their education but their habitations and all that
4966	belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue
4967	as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens Any
4968	man of sense must acknowledge that 
4970	He must 
4971	Then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to
4972	realize our idea of them In the first place none of them should
4973	have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary 
4974	neither should they have a private house or store closed against any
4975	one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such
4976	as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and
4977	courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate
4978	of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they
4979	will go and live together like soldiers in a camp Gold and silver
4980	we will tell them that they have from God the diviner metal is within
4981	them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current
4982	among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly
4983	admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy
4984	deeds but their own is undefiled And they alone of all the citizens
4985	may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof
4986	with them or wear them or drink from them And this will be their
4987	salvation and they will be the saviours of the State But should
4988	they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will
4989	become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and
4990	tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being
4991	hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole
4992	life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies 
4993	and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the State 
4994	will be at hand For all which reasons may we not say that thus shall
4995	our State be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed
4996	by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters 
4997	other 
4999	Yes said Glaucon 
5001	 
5003	BOOK IV
5005	Adeimantus SOCRATES 
5007	Here Adeimantus interposed a question How would you answer Socrates 
5008	said he if a person were to say that you are making these people
5009	miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the
5010	city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it 
5011	whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses 
5012	and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the
5013	gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as
5014	you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that
5015	is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are
5016	no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always
5017	mounting guard 
5019	Yes I said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid
5020	in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot 
5021	if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend
5022	on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes 
5023	is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same
5024	nature might be added 
5026	But said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge 
5028	You mean to ask I said what will be our answer 
5029	Yes 
5030	If we proceed along the old path my belief I said is that we shall
5031	find the answer And our answer will be that even as they are our
5032	guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim
5033	in founding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any
5034	one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that
5035	in a State which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we
5036	should be most likely to find Justice and in the ill ordered State
5037	injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the
5038	two is the happier At present I take it we are fashioning the happy
5039	State not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens 
5040	but as a whole and by and by we will proceed to view the opposite
5041	kind of State Suppose that we were painting a statue and some one
5042	came up to us and said Why do you not put the most beautiful colours
5043	on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple 
5044	but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer Sir 
5045	you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that
5046	they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and
5047	the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful 
5048	And so I say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a
5049	sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for
5050	we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns
5051	of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they
5052	like and no more Our potters also might be allowed to repose on
5053	couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while
5054	their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as
5055	much as they like in this way we might make every class happy and
5056	then as you imagine the whole State would be happy But do not put
5057	this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman
5058	will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter 
5059	and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the State 
5060	Now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society 
5061	and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but
5062	when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly
5063	and not real guardians then see how they turn the State upside down 
5064	and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and
5065	happiness to the State We mean our guardians to be true saviours
5066	and not the destroyers of the State whereas our opponent is thinking
5067	of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not
5068	of citizens who are doing their duty to the State But if so we
5069	mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not
5070	a State And therefore we must consider whether in appointing our
5071	guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually 
5072	or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the
5073	State as a whole But the latter be the truth then the guardians
5074	and auxillaries and all others equally with them must be compelled
5075	or induced to do their own work in the best way And thus the whole
5076	State will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will
5077	receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them 
5079	I think that you are quite right 
5080	I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to
5081	me 
5083	What may that be 
5084	There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts 
5086	What are they 
5087	Wealth I said and poverty 
5088	How do they act 
5089	The process is as follows When a potter becomes rich will he think
5090	you any longer take the same pains with his art 
5092	Certainly not 
5093	He will grow more and more indolent and careless 
5094	Very true 
5095	And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter 
5096	Yes he greatly deteriorates 
5097	But on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself
5098	tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will
5099	he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well 
5101	Certainly not 
5102	Then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen
5103	and their work are equally liable to degenerate 
5105	That is evident 
5106	Here then is a discovery of new evils I said against which the
5107	guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved 
5109	What evils 
5110	Wealth I said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence 
5111	and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent 
5113	That is very true he replied but still I should like to know Socrates 
5114	how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy
5115	who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war 
5117	There would certainly be a difficulty I replied in going to war
5118	with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two
5119	of them 
5121	How so he asked 
5122	In the first place I said if we have to fight our side will be
5123	trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men 
5125	That is true he said 
5126	And do you not suppose Adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect
5127	in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well to do gentlemen
5128	who were not boxers 
5130	Hardly if they came upon him at once 
5131	What not I said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike
5132	at the one who first came up And supposing he were to do this several
5133	times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert 
5134	overturn more than one stout personage 
5136	Certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that 
5138	And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science
5139	and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities 
5141	Likely enough 
5142	Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two
5143	or three times their own number 
5145	I agree with you for I think you right 
5146	And suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to
5147	one of the two cities telling them what is the truth Silver and
5148	gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you
5149	therefore come and help us in war of and take the spoils of the other
5150	city Who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean
5151	wiry dogs rather th than with the dogs on their side against fat
5152	and tender sheep 
5154	That is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor State
5155	if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one 
5157	But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our
5158	own 
5160	Why so 
5161	You ought to speak of other States in the plural number not one of
5162	them is a city but many cities as they say in the game For indeed
5163	any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city
5164	of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another 
5165	and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether
5166	beside the mark if you treated them all as a single State But if
5167	you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons
5168	of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends
5169	and not many enemies And your State while the wise order which has
5170	now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest
5171	of States I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in
5172	deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders 
5173	A single State which is her equal you will hardly find either among
5174	Hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and
5175	many times greater 
5177	That is most true he said 
5178	And what I said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when
5179	they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory
5180	which they are to include and beyond which they will not go 
5182	What limit would you propose 
5183	I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity 
5184	that I think is the proper limit 
5186	Very good he said 
5187	Here then I said is another order which will have to be conveyed
5188	to our guardians Let our city be accounted neither large nor small 
5189	but one and self sufficing 
5191	And surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose
5192	upon them 
5194	And the other said I of which we were speaking before is lighter
5195	still I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians
5196	when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring
5197	of the lower classes when naturally superior The intention was 
5198	that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should
5199	be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him one
5200	to one work and then every man would do his own business and be
5201	one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many 
5203	Yes he said that is not so difficult 
5204	The regulations which we are prescribing my good Adeimantus are
5205	not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles
5206	all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a
5207	thing however which I would rather call not great but sufficient
5208	for our purpose 
5210	What may that be he asked 
5211	Education I said and nurture If our citizens are well educated 
5212	and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through
5213	all these as well as other matters which I omit such for example 
5214	as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children 
5215	which will all follow the general principle that friends have all
5216	things in common as the proverb says 
5218	That will be the best way of settling them 
5219	Also I said the State if once started well moves with accumulating
5220	force like a wheel For good nurture and education implant good constitutions 
5221	and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve
5222	more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in
5223	other animals 
5225	Very possibly he said 
5226	Then to sum up This is the point to which above all the attention
5227	of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved
5228	in their original form and no innovation made They must do their
5229	utmost to maintain them intact And when any one says that mankind
5230	most regard 
5232	The newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he
5233	may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought
5234	not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for
5235	any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State and ought
5236	to be prohibited So Damon tells me and I can quite believe him he
5237	says that when modes of music change of the State always change with
5238	them 
5240	Yes said Adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to Damon s and your
5241	own 
5243	Then I said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
5244	in music 
5246	Yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals
5247	in 
5249	Yes I replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears
5250	harmless 
5252	Why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by
5253	little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates
5254	into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades
5255	contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws
5256	and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last Socrates 
5257	by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public 
5259	Is that true I said 
5260	That is my belief he replied 
5261	Then as I was saying our youth should be trained from the first
5262	in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths
5263	themselves become lawless they can never grow up into well conducted
5264	and virtuous citizens 
5266	Very true he said 
5267	And when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help
5268	of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order 
5269	in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany
5270	them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and
5271	if there be any fallen places a principle in the State will raise
5272	them up again 
5274	Very true he said 
5275	Thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which
5276	their predecessors have altogether neglected 
5278	What do you mean 
5279	I mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before
5280	their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and
5281	making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes
5282	are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners
5283	in general You would agree with me 
5285	Yes 
5286	But there is I think small wisdom in legislating about such matters 
5287	 I doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments
5288	about them likely to be lasting 
5290	Impossible 
5291	It would seem Adeimantus that the direction in which education starts
5292	a man will determine his future life Does not like always attract
5293	like 
5295	To be sure 
5296	Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good 
5297	and may be the reverse of good 
5299	That is not to be denied 
5300	And for this reason I said I shall not attempt to legislate further
5301	about them 
5303	Naturally enough he replied 
5304	Well and about the business of the agora dealings and the ordinary
5305	dealings between man and man or again about agreements with the commencement
5306	with artisans about insult and injury of the commencement of actions 
5307	and the appointment of juries what would you say there may also
5308	arise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and
5309	harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations
5310	of markets police harbours and the like But oh heavens shall
5311	we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars 
5313	I think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them
5314	on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon
5315	enough for themselves 
5317	Yes I said my friend if God will only preserve to them the laws
5318	which we have given them 
5320	And without divine help said Adeimantus they will go on for ever
5321	making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining
5322	perfection 
5324	You would compare them I said to those invalids who having no self restraint 
5325	will not leave off their habits of intemperance 
5327	Exactly 
5328	Yes I said and what a delightful life they lead they are always
5329	doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always
5330	fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises
5331	them to try 
5333	Such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort 
5335	Yes I replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their
5336	worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless
5337	they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither
5338	drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail 
5340	Charming he replied I see nothing charming in going into a passion
5341	with a man who tells you what is right 
5343	These gentlemen I said do not seem to be in your good graces 
5345	Assuredly not 
5346	Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men
5347	whom I was just now describing For are there not ill ordered States
5348	in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the
5349	constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under
5350	this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in
5351	anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and
5352	good statesman do not these States resemble the persons whom I was
5353	describing 
5355	Yes he said the States are as bad as the men and I am very far
5356	from praising them 
5358	But do you not admire I said the coolness and dexterity of these
5359	ready ministers of political corruption 
5361	Yes he said I do but not of all of them for there are some whom
5362	the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they
5363	are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired 
5365	What do you mean I said you should have more feeling for them When
5366	a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare
5367	that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say 
5369	Nay he said certainly not in that case 
5370	Well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as
5371	a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing 
5372	they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end
5373	of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which I was mentioning 
5374	not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra 
5376	Yes he said that is just what they are doing 
5377	I conceive I said that the true legislator will not trouble himself
5378	with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution
5379	either in an ill ordered or in a well ordered State for in the former
5380	they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty
5381	in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our
5382	previous regulations 
5384	What then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation 
5386	Nothing to us I replied but to Apollo the God of Delphi there
5387	remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things
5388	of all 
5390	Which are they he said 
5391	The institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service
5392	of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories
5393	of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would
5394	propitiate the inhabitants of the world below These are matters of
5395	which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should
5396	be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity 
5397	He is the god who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and
5398	he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind 
5400	You are right and we will do as you propose 
5401	But where amid all this is justice son of Ariston tell me where 
5402	Now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search 
5403	and get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to
5404	help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where
5405	injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of
5406	them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether
5407	seen or unseen by gods and men 
5409	Socrates GLAUCON 
5411	Nonsense said Glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying
5412	that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety 
5414	I do not deny that I said so and as you remind me I will be as good
5415	as my word but you must join 
5417	We will he replied 
5418	Well then I hope to make the discovery in this way I mean to begin
5419	with the assumption that our State if rightly ordered is perfect 
5421	That is most certain 
5422	And being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and
5423	just 
5425	That is likewise clear 
5426	And whichever of these qualities we find in the State the one which
5427	is not found will be the residue 
5429	Very good 
5430	If there were four things and we were searching for one of them 
5431	wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from
5432	the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know
5433	the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one
5434	left 
5436	Very true he said 
5437	And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which
5438	are also four in number 
5440	Clearly 
5441	First among the virtues found in the State wisdom comes into view 
5442	and in this I detect a certain peculiarity 
5444	What is that 
5445	The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being
5446	good in counsel 
5448	Very true 
5449	And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance 
5450	but by knowledge do men counsel well 
5452	Clearly 
5453	And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse 
5455	Of course 
5456	There is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge
5457	which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel 
5459	Certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill
5460	in carpentering 
5462	Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge
5463	which counsels for the best about wooden implements 
5465	Certainly not 
5466	Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots I said 
5467	nor as possessing any other similar knowledge 
5469	Not by reason of any of them he said 
5470	Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that
5471	would give the city the name of agricultural 
5473	Yes 
5474	Well I said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded State
5475	among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular
5476	thing in the State but about the whole and considers how a State
5477	can best deal with itself and with other States 
5479	There certainly is 
5480	And what is knowledge and among whom is it found I asked 
5482	It is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and found among
5483	those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians 
5485	And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of
5486	this sort of knowledge 
5488	The name of good in counsel and truly wise 
5489	And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more
5490	smiths 
5492	The smiths he replied will be far more numerous 
5493	Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive
5494	a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge 
5496	Much the smallest 
5497	And so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge
5498	which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole
5499	State being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and
5500	this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has
5501	been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least 
5503	Most true 
5504	Thus then I said the nature and place in the State of one of the
5505	four virtues has somehow or other been discovered 
5507	And in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied 
5509	Again I said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage 
5510	and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous
5511	to the State 
5513	How do you mean 
5514	Why I said every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly 
5515	will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the
5516	State s behalf 
5518	No one he replied would ever think of any other 
5519	Certainly not 
5520	The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but
5521	their courage or cowardice will not as I conceive have the effect
5522	of making the city either the one or the other 
5524	The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which
5525	preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of
5526	things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated
5527	them and this is what you term courage 
5529	I should like to hear what you are saying once more for I do not
5530	think that I perfectly understand you 
5532	I mean that courage is a kind of salvation 
5533	Salvation of what 
5534	Of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of
5535	what nature which the law implants through education and I mean
5536	by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure
5537	or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves 
5538	and does not lose this opinion Shall I give you an illustration 
5540	If you please 
5541	You know I said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making
5542	the true sea purple begin by selecting their white colour first 
5543	this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that
5544	the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection The dyeing
5545	then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast
5546	colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away
5547	the bloom But when the ground has not been duly prepared you will
5548	have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other
5549	colour 
5551	Yes he said I know that they have a washed out and ridiculous appearance 
5553	Then now I said you will understand what our object was in selecting
5554	our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving
5555	influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in
5556	perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every
5557	other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training 
5558	not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent
5559	far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear 
5560	and desire the mightiest of all other solvents And this sort of
5561	universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about
5562	real and false dangers I call and maintain to be courage unless you
5563	disagree 
5565	But I agree he replied for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere
5566	uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this 
5567	in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought
5568	to have another name 
5570	Most certainly 
5571	Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe 
5572	Why yes said I you may and if you add the words of a citizen 
5573	you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry
5574	the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for
5575	courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said
5576	enough 
5578	You are right he replied 
5579	Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State first temperance 
5580	and then justice which is the end of our search 
5582	Very true 
5583	Now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance 
5585	I do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do I desire
5586	that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight
5587	of and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering
5588	temperance first 
5590	Certainly I replied I should not be justified in refusing your request 
5592	Then consider he said 
5593	Yes I replied I will and as far as I can at present see the virtue
5594	of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than
5595	the preceding 
5597	How so he asked 
5598	Temperance I replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures
5599	and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a
5600	man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may
5601	be found in language 
5603	No doubt he said 
5604	There is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself 
5605	for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and
5606	in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted 
5608	Certainly 
5609	The meaning is I believe that in the human soul there is a better
5610	and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under
5611	control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a
5612	term of praise but when owing to evil education or association 
5613	the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by
5614	the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called
5615	the slave of self and unprincipled 
5617	Yes there is reason in that 
5618	And now I said look at our newly created State and there you will
5619	find one of these two conditions realised for the State as you will
5620	acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance 
5621	and self mastery truly express the rule of the better part over
5622	the worse 
5624	Yes he said I see that what you say is true 
5625	Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
5626	and pains are generally found in children and women and servants 
5627	and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous
5628	class 
5630	Certainly he said 
5631	Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are
5632	under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only
5633	in a few and those the best born and best educated 
5635	Very true These two as you may perceive have a place in our State 
5636	and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires
5637	and wisdom of the few 
5639	That I perceive he said 
5640	Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its
5641	own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such
5642	a designation 
5644	Certainly he replied 
5645	It may also be called temperate and for the same reasons 
5647	Yes 
5648	And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed
5649	as to the question who are to rule that again will be our State 
5651	Undoubtedly 
5652	And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class
5653	will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects 
5655	In both as I should imagine he replied 
5656	Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance
5657	was a sort of harmony 
5659	Why so 
5660	Why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which
5661	resides in a part only the one making the State wise and the other
5662	valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through
5663	all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and
5664	the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be
5665	stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything
5666	else Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of
5667	the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either 
5668	both in states and individuals 
5670	I entirely agree with you 
5671	And so I said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have
5672	been discovered in our State The last of those qualities which make
5673	a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was 
5675	The inference is obvious 
5676	The time then has arrived Glaucon when like huntsmen we should
5677	surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away 
5678	and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere
5679	in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her 
5680	and if you see her first let me know 
5682	Would that I could but you should regard me rather as a follower
5683	who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about
5684	as much as I am good for 
5686	Offer up a prayer with me and follow 
5687	I will but you must show me the way 
5688	Here is no path I said and the wood is dark and perplexing still
5689	we must push on 
5691	Let us push on 
5692	Here I saw something Halloo I said I begin to perceive a track 
5693	and I believe that the quarry will not escape 
5695	Good news he said 
5696	Truly I said we are stupid fellows 
5697	Why so 
5698	Why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there
5699	was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing
5700	could be more ridiculous Like people who go about looking for what
5701	they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not
5702	at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance 
5703	and therefore I suppose we missed her 
5705	What do you mean 
5706	I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking
5707	of justice and have failed to recognise her 
5709	I grow impatient at the length of your exordium 
5710	Well then tell me I said whether I am right or not You remember
5711	the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation
5712	of the State that one man should practise one thing only the thing
5713	to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle
5714	or a part of it 
5716	Yes we often said that one man should do one thing only 
5718	Further we affirmed that justice was doing one s own business and
5719	not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others
5720	have said the same to us 
5722	Yes we said so 
5723	Then to do one s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be
5724	justice Can you tell me whence I derive this inference 
5726	I cannot but I should like to be told 
5727	Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the
5728	State when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom
5729	are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition
5730	of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also
5731	their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered
5732	by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one 
5734	That follows of necessity 
5735	If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its
5736	presence contributes most to the excellence of the State whether
5737	the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers
5738	of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers 
5739	or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which
5740	I am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and
5741	freeman artisan ruler subject the quality I mean of every
5742	one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the
5743	palm the question is not so easily answered 
5745	Certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which 
5747	Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work
5748	appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance 
5749	courage 
5751	Yes he said 
5752	And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice 
5754	Exactly 
5755	Let us look at the question from another point of view Are not the
5756	rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining
5757	suits at law 
5759	Certainly 
5760	And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither
5761	take what is another s nor be deprived of what is his own 
5763	Yes that is their principle 
5764	Which is a just principle 
5765	Yes 
5766	Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and
5767	doing what is a man s own and belongs to him 
5769	Very true 
5770	Think now and say whether you agree with me or not Suppose a carpenter
5771	to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter 
5772	and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or
5773	the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change 
5774	do you think that any great harm would result to the State 
5776	Not much 
5777	But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a
5778	trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number
5779	of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way
5780	into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators
5781	and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements
5782	or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator 
5783	and warrior all in one then I think you will agree with me in saying
5784	that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the
5785	ruin of the State 
5787	Most true 
5788	Seeing then I said that there are three distinct classes any meddling
5789	of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest
5790	harm to the State and may be most justly termed evil doing 
5792	Precisely 
5793	And the greatest degree of evil doing to one s own city would be termed
5794	by you injustice 
5796	Certainly 
5797	This then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the
5798	auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice 
5799	and will make the city just 
5801	I agree with you 
5802	We will not I said be over positive as yet but if on trial this
5803	conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in
5804	the State there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not
5805	verified we must have a fresh enquiry First let us complete the
5806	old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression
5807	that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale 
5808	there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual 
5809	That larger example appeared to be the State and accordingly we constructed
5810	as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good State justice
5811	would be found Let the discovery which we made be now applied to
5812	the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there
5813	be a difference in the individual we will come back to the State
5814	and have another trial of the theory The friction of the two when
5815	rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will
5816	shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in
5817	our souls 
5819	That will be in regular course let us do as you say 
5820	I proceeded to ask When two things a greater and less are called
5821	by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called
5822	the same 
5824	Like he replied 
5825	The just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be
5826	like the just State 
5828	He will 
5829	And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in
5830	the State severally did their own business and also thought to be
5831	temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections
5832	and qualities of these same classes 
5834	True he said 
5835	And so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three
5836	principles in his own soul which are found in the State and he may
5837	be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in
5838	the same manner 
5840	Certainly he said 
5841	Once more then O my friend we have alighted upon an easy question
5842	 whether the soul has these three principles or not 
5844	An easy question Nay rather Socrates the proverb holds that hard
5845	is the good 
5847	Very true I said and I do not think that the method which we are
5848	employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question 
5849	the true method is another and a longer one Still we may arrive at
5850	a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry 
5852	May we not be satisfied with that he said under the circumstances 
5853	I am quite content 
5855	I too I replied shall be extremely well satisfied 
5856	Then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said 
5857	Must we not acknowledge I said that in each of us there are the
5858	same principles and habits which there are in the State and that
5859	from the individual they pass into the State how else can they
5860	come there Take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous
5861	to imagine that this quality when found in States is not derived
5862	from the individuals who are supposed to possess it e g the Thracians 
5863	Scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be
5864	said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic
5865	of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with
5866	equal truth be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians 
5868	Exactly so he said 
5869	There is no difficulty in understanding this 
5870	None whatever 
5871	But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
5872	these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn
5873	with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third
5874	part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether
5875	the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine
5876	that is the difficulty 
5878	Yes he said there lies the difficulty 
5879	Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different 
5881	How can we he asked 
5882	I replied as follows The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted
5883	upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same
5884	time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction
5885	occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really
5886	not the same but different 
5888	Good 
5889	For example I said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at
5890	the same time in the same part 
5892	Impossible 
5893	Still I said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest
5894	we should hereafter fall out by the way Imagine the case of a man
5895	who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose
5896	a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest
5897	at the same moment to such a mode of speech we should object and
5898	should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another
5899	is at rest 
5901	Very true 
5902	And suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the
5903	nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when
5904	they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and
5905	in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which
5906	revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by
5907	us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in
5908	the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have
5909	both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still 
5910	for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference
5911	goes round But if while revolving the axis inclines either to the
5912	right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can
5913	they be at rest 
5915	That is the correct mode of describing them he replied 
5917	Then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe
5918	that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation
5919	to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways 
5921	Certainly not according to my way of thinking 
5922	Yet I said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections 
5923	and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity 
5924	and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption
5925	turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be
5926	withdrawn 
5928	Yes he said that will be the best way 
5929	Well I said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire
5930	and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites 
5931	whether they are regarded as active or passive for that makes no
5932	difference in the fact of their opposition 
5934	Yes he said they are opposites 
5935	Well I said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and
5936	again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes
5937	already mentioned You would say would you not that the soul
5938	of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires or
5939	that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess 
5940	or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind 
5941	longing for the realisation of his desires intimates his wish to
5942	have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question 
5944	Very true 
5945	And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence
5946	of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion
5947	and rejection 
5949	Certainly 
5950	Admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular
5951	class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst 
5952	as they are termed which are the most obvious of them 
5954	Let us take that class he said 
5955	The object of one is food and of the other drink 
5956	Yes 
5957	And here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul
5958	has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything
5959	else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word 
5960	drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by
5961	heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold 
5962	then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink
5963	which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity
5964	of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire
5965	drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst 
5966	as food is of hunger 
5968	Yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the
5969	simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object 
5971	But here a confusion may arise and I should wish to guard against
5972	an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only 
5973	but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal
5974	object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst
5975	after good drink and the same is true of every other desire 
5977	Yes he replied the opponent might have something to say 
5979	Nevertheless I should still maintain that of relatives some have
5980	a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple
5981	and have their correlatives simple 
5983	I do not know what you mean 
5984	Well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less 
5986	Certainly 
5987	And the much greater to the much less 
5988	Yes 
5989	And the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that
5990	is to be to the less that is to be 
5992	Certainly he said 
5993	And so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the
5994	double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter
5995	and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is
5996	not this true of all of them 
5998	Yes 
5999	And does not the same principle hold in the sciences The object of
6000	science is knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but
6001	the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge 
6002	I mean for example that the science of house building is a kind
6003	of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and
6004	is therefore termed architecture 
6006	Certainly 
6007	Because it has a particular quality which no other has 
6008	Yes 
6009	And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular
6010	kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences 
6012	Yes 
6013	Now then if I have made myself clear you will understand my original
6014	meaning in what I said about relatives My meaning was that if one
6015	term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one
6016	term is qualified the other is also qualified I do not mean to say
6017	that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health
6018	is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences
6019	of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when
6020	the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified
6021	object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it
6022	becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science
6023	of medicine 
6025	I quite understand and I think as you do 
6026	Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative
6027	terms having clearly a relation 
6029	Yes thirst is relative to drink 
6030	And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink 
6031	but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good
6032	nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only 
6034	Certainly 
6035	Then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires
6036	only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it 
6038	That is plain 
6039	And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from
6040	drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws
6041	him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing
6042	cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary
6043	ways about the same 
6045	Impossible 
6046	No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull
6047	the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes
6048	and the other pulls 
6050	Exactly so he replied 
6051	And might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink 
6052	Yes he said it constantly happens 
6053	And in such a case what is one to say Would you not say that there
6054	was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else
6055	forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which
6056	bids him 
6058	I should say so 
6059	And the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which
6060	bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease 
6062	Clearly 
6063	Then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ
6064	from one another the one with which man reasons we may call the
6065	rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and
6066	hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire 
6067	may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures
6068	and satisfactions 
6070	Yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different 
6072	Then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing
6073	in the soul And what of passion or spirit Is it a third or akin
6074	to one of the preceding 
6076	I should be inclined to say akin to desire 
6077	Well I said there is a story which I remember to have heard and
6078	in which I put faith The story is that Leontius the son of Aglaion 
6079	coming up one day from the Piraeus under the north wall on the outside 
6080	observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution 
6081	He felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them 
6082	for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire
6083	got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead
6084	bodies saying Look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight 
6086	I have heard the story myself he said 
6087	The moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire 
6088	as though they were two distinct things 
6090	Yes that is the meaning he said 
6091	And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a
6092	man s desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself 
6093	and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle 
6094	which is like the struggle of factions in a State his spirit is on
6095	the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element
6096	to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed 
6097	is a sort of thing which thing which I believe that you never observed
6098	occurring in yourself nor as I should imagine in any one else 
6100	Certainly not 
6101	Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler
6102	he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such
6103	as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may
6104	inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as I say his anger
6105	refuses to be excited by them 
6107	True he said 
6108	But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils
6109	and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice 
6110	and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the
6111	more determined to persevere and conquer His noble spirit will not
6112	be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the
6113	voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more 
6115	The illustration is perfect he replied and in our State as we were
6116	saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of
6117	the rulers who are their shepherds 
6119	I perceive I said that you quite understand me there is however 
6120	a further point which I wish you to consider 
6122	What point 
6123	You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be
6124	a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in
6125	the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational
6126	principle 
6128	Most assuredly 
6129	But a further question arises Is passion different from reason also 
6130	or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles
6131	in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent 
6132	or rather as the State was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries 
6133	counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element
6134	which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education
6135	is the natural auxiliary of reason 
6137	Yes he said there must be a third 
6138	Yes I replied if passion which has already been shown to be different
6139	from desire turn out also to be different from reason 
6141	But that is easily proved We may observe even in young children
6142	that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas
6143	some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of
6144	them late enough 
6146	Excellent I said and you may see passion equally in brute animals 
6147	which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying And
6148	we may once more appeal to the words of Homer which have been already
6149	quoted by us 
6151	He smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse
6152	Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better
6153	and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked
6154	by it 
6156	Very true he said 
6157	And so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed
6158	that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the
6159	individual and that they are three in number 
6161	Exactly 
6162	Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way 
6163	and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise 
6165	Certainly 
6166	Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State
6167	constitutes courage in the individual and that both the State and
6168	the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues 
6170	Assuredly 
6171	And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same
6172	way in which the State is just 
6174	That follows of course 
6175	We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in
6176	each of the three classes doing the work of its own class 
6178	We are not very likely to have forgotten he said 
6179	We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities
6180	of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own
6181	work 
6183	Yes he said we must remember that too 
6184	And ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care
6185	of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle
6186	to be the subject and ally 
6188	Certainly 
6189	And as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic
6190	will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with
6191	noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing
6192	the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm 
6194	Quite true he said 
6195	And these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly
6196	to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which
6197	in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable
6198	of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong
6199	with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent
6200	soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave
6201	and rule those who are not her natural born subjects and overturn
6202	the whole life of man 
6204	Very true he said 
6205	Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul
6206	and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling 
6207	and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing
6208	his commands and counsels 
6210	True 
6211	And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure
6212	and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not
6213	to fear 
6215	Right he replied 
6216	And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules 
6217	and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to
6218	have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three
6219	parts and of the whole 
6221	Assuredly 
6222	And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
6223	in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and
6224	the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that
6225	reason ought to rule and do not rebel 
6227	Certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether
6228	in the State or individual 
6230	And surely I said we have explained again and again how and by virtue
6231	of what quality a man will be just 
6233	That is very certain 
6234	And is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different 
6235	or is she the same which we found her to be in the State 
6237	There is no difference in my opinion he said 
6238	Because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace
6239	instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying 
6241	What sort of instances do you mean 
6242	If the case is put to us must we not admit that the just State or
6243	the man who is trained in the principles of such a State will be
6244	less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or
6245	silver Would any one deny this 
6247	No one he replied 
6248	Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft 
6249	or treachery either to his friends or to his country 
6251	Never 
6252	Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements 
6254	Impossible 
6255	No one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his
6256	father and mother or to fall in his religious duties 
6258	No one 
6259	And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business 
6260	whether in ruling or being ruled 
6262	Exactly so 
6263	Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
6264	states is justice or do you hope to discover some other 
6266	Not I indeed 
6267	Then our dream has been realised and the suspicion which we entertained
6268	at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power
6269	must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been
6270	verified 
6272	Yes certainly 
6273	And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker
6274	and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and
6275	not another s was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was
6276	of use 
6278	Clearly 
6279	But in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned
6280	however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the
6281	true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit
6282	the several elements within him to interfere with one another or
6283	any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner
6284	life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself 
6285	and when he has bound together the three principles within him which
6286	may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale 
6287	and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together 
6288	and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly
6289	adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether
6290	in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some
6291	affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling
6292	that which preserves and co operates with this harmonious condition 
6293	just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom 
6294	and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust
6295	action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance 
6297	You have said the exact truth Socrates 
6298	Very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just
6299	man and the just State and the nature of justice in each of them 
6300	we should not be telling a falsehood 
6302	Most certainly not 
6303	May we say so then 
6304	Let us say so 
6305	And now I said injustice has to be considered 
6306	Clearly 
6307	Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles
6308	 a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the
6309	soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which
6310	is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he
6311	is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but
6312	injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every
6313	form of vice 
6315	Exactly so 
6316	And if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning
6317	of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly 
6318	will also be perfectly clear 
6320	What do you mean he said 
6321	Why I said they are like disease and health being in the soul just
6322	what disease and health are in the body 
6324	How so he said 
6325	Why I said that which is healthy causes health and that which is
6326	unhealthy causes disease 
6328	Yes 
6329	And just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice 
6331	That is certain 
6332	And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and
6333	government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation
6334	of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with
6335	this natural order 
6337	True 
6338	And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order
6339	and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the
6340	creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance
6341	with the natural order 
6343	Exactly so he said 
6344	Then virtue is the health and beauty and well being of the soul and
6345	vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same 
6347	True 
6348	And do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice 
6350	Assuredly 
6351	Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and
6352	injustice has not been answered Which is the more profitable to
6353	be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen
6354	of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished
6355	and unreformed 
6357	In my judgment Socrates the question has now become ridiculous 
6358	We know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer
6359	endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and
6360	having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the
6361	very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life
6362	is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever
6363	he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice
6364	and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both
6365	to be such as we have described 
6367	Yes I said the question is as you say ridiculous Still as we
6368	are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner
6369	with our own eyes let us not faint by the way 
6371	Certainly not he replied 
6372	Come up hither I said and behold the various forms of vice those
6373	of them I mean which are worth looking at 
6375	I am following you he replied proceed 
6376	I said The argument seems to have reached a height from which as
6377	from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue
6378	is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four
6379	special ones which are deserving of note 
6381	What do you mean he said 
6382	I mean I replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul
6383	as there are distinct forms of the State 
6385	How many 
6386	There are five of the State and five of the soul I said 
6388	What are they 
6389	The first I said is that which we have been describing and which
6390	may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly
6391	as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many 
6393	True he replied 
6394	But I regard the two names as describing one form only for whether
6395	the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have
6396	been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental
6397	laws of the State will be maintained 
6399	That is true he replied 
6401	 
6403	BOOK V
6405	Socrates GLAUCON ADEIMANTUS 
6407	Such is the good and true City or State and the good and man is of
6408	the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the
6409	evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State but
6410	also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four
6411	forms 
6413	What are they he said 
6414	I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared
6415	to me to succeed one another when Pole marchus who was sitting a
6416	little way off just beyond Adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching
6417	forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the
6418	shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as
6419	to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which I only
6420	caught the words Shall we let him off or what shall we do 
6422	Certainly not said Adeimantus raising his voice 
6423	Who is it I said whom you are refusing to let off 
6424	You he said 
6425	I repeated Why am I especially not to be let off 
6426	Why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out
6427	of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and
6428	you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as
6429	if it were self evident to everybody that in the matter of women
6430	and children friends have all things in common 
6432	And was I not right Adeimantus 
6433	Yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything
6434	else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds 
6435	Please therefore to say what sort of community you mean We have
6436	been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family
6437	life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world 
6438	and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the
6439	nature of this community of women and children for we are of opinion
6440	that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great
6441	and paramount influence on the State for good or for evil And now 
6442	since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand
6443	another State we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until
6444	you give an account of all this 
6446	To that resolution said Glaucon you may regard me as saying Agreed 
6448	Socrates ADEIMANTUS GLAUCON THRASYMACHUS 
6450	And without more ado said Thrasymachus you may consider us all to
6451	be equally agreed 
6453	I said You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me What
6454	an argument are you raising about the State Just as I thought that
6455	I had finished and was only too glad that I had laid this question
6456	to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance
6457	of what I then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation 
6458	ignorant of what a hornet s nest of words you are stirring Now I
6459	foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it 
6461	For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said Thrasymachus 
6462	 to look for gold or to hear discourse 
6464	Yes but discourse should have a limit 
6465	Yes Socrates said Glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit
6466	which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses But never
6467	mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your
6468	own way What sort of community of women and children is this which
6469	is to prevail among our guardians and how shall we manage the period
6470	between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care 
6471	Tell us how these things will be 
6473	Yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many
6474	more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions 
6475	For the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked
6476	at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable 
6477	would be for the best is also doubtful Hence I feel a reluctance
6478	to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should
6479	turn out to be a dream only 
6481	Fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you 
6482	they are not sceptical or hostile 
6484	I said My good friend I suppose that you mean to encourage me by
6485	these words 
6487	Yes he said 
6488	Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement
6489	which you offer would have been all very well had I myself believed
6490	that I knew what I was talking about to declare the truth about matters
6491	of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who
6492	love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry
6493	on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which
6494	is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger
6495	is not that I shall be laughed at of which the fear would be childish 
6496	but that I shall miss the truth where I have most need to be sure
6497	of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall And I pray
6498	Nemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am going to utter 
6499	For I do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less
6500	crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in
6501	the matter of laws And that is a risk which I would rather run among
6502	enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage
6503	me 
6505	Glaucon laughed and said Well then Socrates in case you and your
6506	argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand
6507	of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and
6508	speak 
6510	Well I said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free
6511	from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument 
6513	Then why should you mind 
6514	Well I replied I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what
6515	I perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place The part
6516	of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the
6517	turn of the women Of them I will proceed to speak and the more readily
6518	since I am invited by you 
6520	For men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion 
6521	of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of
6522	women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started 
6523	when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of
6524	the herd 
6526	True 
6527	Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
6528	subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see
6529	whether the result accords with our design 
6531	What do you mean 
6532	What I mean may be put into the form of a question I said Are dogs
6533	divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting
6534	and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs or do we entrust
6535	to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we
6536	leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling
6537	their puppies is labour enough for them 
6539	No he said they share alike the only difference between them is
6540	that the males are stronger and the females weaker 
6542	But can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they
6543	are bred and fed in the same way 
6545	You cannot 
6546	Then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have
6547	the same nurture and education 
6549	Yes 
6550	The education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic 
6551	Yes 
6553	Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of
6554	war which they must practise like the men 
6556	That is the inference I suppose 
6557	I should rather expect I said that several of our proposals if
6558	they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous 
6560	No doubt of it 
6561	Yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women
6562	naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they
6563	are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty 
6564	any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and
6565	ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia 
6567	Yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would
6568	be thought ridiculous 
6570	But then I said as we have determined to speak our minds we must
6571	not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this
6572	sort of innovation how they will talk of women s attainments both
6573	in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and
6574	riding upon horseback 
6576	Very true he replied 
6577	Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law 
6578	at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life
6579	to be serious Not long ago as we shall remind them the Hellenes
6580	were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians 
6581	that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when
6582	first the Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom 
6583	the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation 
6585	No doubt 
6586	But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was
6587	far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the
6588	outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted 
6589	then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of
6590	his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously
6591	inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of
6592	the good 
6594	Very true he replied 
6595	First then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest 
6596	let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman Is she
6597	capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men 
6598	or not at all And is the art of war one of those arts in which she
6599	can or can not share That will be the best way of commencing the
6600	enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion 
6602	That will be much the best way 
6603	Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves 
6604	in this manner the adversary s position will not be undefended 
6606	Why not he said 
6607	Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents They will
6608	say Socrates and Glaucon no adversary need convict you for you
6609	yourselves at the first foundation of the State admitted the principle
6610	that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature And
6611	certainly if I am not mistaken such an admission was made by us 
6612	 And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed 
6613	And we shall reply Of course they do Then we shall be asked Whether
6614	the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and
6615	such as are agreeable to their different natures Certainly they
6616	should But if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency
6617	in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different 
6618	ought to perform the same actions What defence will you make for
6619	us my good Sir against any one who offers these objections 
6621	That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and I
6622	shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side 
6624	These are the objections Glaucon and there are many others of a
6625	like kind which I foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant
6626	to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women
6627	and children 
6629	By Zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy 
6631	Why yes I said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth 
6632	whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean 
6633	he has to swim all the same 
6635	Very true 
6636	And must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that
6637	Arion s dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us 
6639	I suppose so he said 
6640	Well then let us see if any way of escape can be found We acknowledged
6641	 did we not that different natures ought to have different pursuits 
6642	and that men s and women s natures are different And now what are
6643	we saying that different natures ought to have the same pursuits 
6644	 this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us 
6646	Precisely 
6647	Verily Glaucon I said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction 
6649	Why do you say so 
6650	Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his
6651	will When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing 
6652	just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which
6653	he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the
6654	spirit of contention and not of fair discussion 
6656	Yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to
6657	do with us and our argument 
6659	A great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally
6660	into a verbal opposition 
6662	In what way 
6663	Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that
6664	different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered
6665	at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or
6666	why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different
6667	natures and the same to the same natures 
6669	Why no he said that was never considered by us 
6670	I said Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question
6671	whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and
6672	hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers 
6673	we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely 
6675	That would be a jest he said 
6676	Yes I said a jest and why because we never meant when we constructed
6677	the State that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference 
6678	but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which
6679	the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that
6680	a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have
6681	the same nature 
6683	True 
6684	Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures 
6686	Certainly 
6687	And if I said the male and female sex appear to differ in their
6688	fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or
6689	art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference
6690	consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does
6691	not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of
6692	the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue
6693	to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same
6694	pursuits 
6696	Very true he said 
6697	Next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits
6698	or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of
6699	a man 
6701	That will be quite fair 
6702	And perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient
6703	answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there
6704	is no difficulty 
6706	Yes perhaps 
6707	Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and
6708	then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the
6709	constitution of women which would affect them in the administration
6710	of the State 
6712	By all means 
6713	Let us say to him Come now and we will ask you a question when
6714	you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you
6715	mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with
6716	difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great
6717	deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner
6718	learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a
6719	body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other
6720	is a hindrance to him would not these be the sort of differences
6721	which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted 
6723	No one will deny that 
6724	And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has
6725	not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female 
6726	Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management
6727	of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to
6728	be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things
6729	the most absurd 
6731	You are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority
6732	of the female sex although many women are in many things superior
6733	to many men yet on the whole what you say is true 
6735	And if so my friend I said there is no special faculty of administration
6736	in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man
6737	has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused
6738	in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but
6739	in all of them a woman is inferior to a man 
6741	Very true 
6742	Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on
6743	women 
6745	That will never do 
6746	One woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and
6747	another has no music in her nature 
6749	Very true 
6750	And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and
6751	another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics 
6753	Certainly 
6754	And one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy 
6755	one has spirit and another is without spirit 
6757	That is also true 
6758	Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not 
6759	Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences
6760	of this sort 
6762	Yes 
6763	Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they
6764	differ only in their comparative strength or weakness 
6766	Obviously 
6767	And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
6768	companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom
6769	they resemble in capacity and in character 
6771	Very true 
6772	And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits 
6774	They ought 
6775	Then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning
6776	music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point
6777	we come round again 
6779	Certainly not 
6780	The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore
6781	not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice 
6782	which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature 
6784	That appears to be true 
6785	We had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and
6786	secondly whether they were the most beneficial 
6788	Yes 
6789	And the possibility has been acknowledged 
6790	Yes 
6791	The very great benefit has next to be established 
6792	Quite so 
6793	You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian
6794	will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the
6795	same 
6797	Yes 
6798	I should like to ask you a question 
6799	What is it 
6800	Would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man
6801	better than another 
6803	The latter 
6804	And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
6805	guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more
6806	perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling 
6808	What a ridiculous question 
6809	You have answered me I replied Well and may we not further say
6810	that our guardians are the best of our citizens 
6812	By far the best 
6813	And will not their wives be the best women 
6814	Yes by far the best 
6815	And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than
6816	that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible 
6818	There can be nothing better 
6819	And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in
6820	such manner as we have described will accomplish 
6822	Certainly 
6823	Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest
6824	degree beneficial to the State 
6826	True 
6827	Then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be
6828	their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence
6829	of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter
6830	are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in
6831	other respects their duties are to be the same And as for the man
6832	who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of
6833	motives in his laughter he is plucking 
6835	A fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is
6836	laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be 
6837	the best of sayings That the useful is the noble and the hurtful
6838	is the base 
6840	Very true 
6841	Here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may
6842	say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive
6843	for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their
6844	pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of
6845	this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears
6846	witness 
6848	Yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped 
6849	Yes I said but a greater is coming you will of this when you see
6850	the next 
6852	Go on let me see 
6853	The law I said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded 
6854	is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are
6855	to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is
6856	to know his own child nor any child his parent 
6858	Yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the
6859	possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable 
6861	I do not think I said that there can be any dispute about the very
6862	great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility
6863	is quite another matter and will be very much disputed 
6865	I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both 
6867	You imply that the two questions must be combined I replied Now
6868	I meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as I thought 
6869	I should escape from one of them and then there would remain only
6870	the possibility 
6872	But that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please
6873	to give a defence of both 
6875	Well I said I submit to my fate Yet grant me a little favour let
6876	me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of
6877	feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have
6878	discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter
6879	which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves
6880	by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire
6881	is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight
6882	in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that
6883	is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which
6884	was never good for much Now I myself am beginning to lose heart 
6885	and I should like with your permission to pass over the question
6886	of possibility at present Assuming therefore the possibility of the
6887	proposal I shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry
6888	out these arrangements and I shall demonstrate that our plan if
6889	executed will be of the greatest benefit to the State and to the
6890	guardians First of all then if you have no objection I will endeavour
6891	with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter
6892	the question of possibility 
6894	I have no objection proceed 
6895	First I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be
6896	worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey
6897	in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must
6898	themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of
6899	them in any details which are entrusted to their care 
6901	That is right he said 
6902	You I said who are their legislator having selected the men will
6903	now select the women and give them to them they must be as far
6904	as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common
6905	houses and meet at common meals None of them will have anything specially
6906	his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together 
6907	and will associate at gymnastic exercises And so they will be drawn
6908	by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other
6909	 necessity is not too strong a word I think 
6911	Yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity
6912	which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining
6913	to the mass of mankind 
6915	True I said and this Glaucon like all the rest must proceed after
6916	an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an
6917	unholy thing which the rulers will forbid 
6919	Yes he said and it ought not to be permitted 
6920	Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the
6921	highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred 
6923	Exactly 
6924	And how can marriages be made most beneficial that is a question
6925	which I put to you because I see in your house dogs for hunting 
6926	and of the nobler sort of birds not a few Now I beseech you do
6927	tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding 
6929	In what particulars 
6930	Why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are
6931	not some better than others 
6933	True 
6934	And do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care
6935	to breed from the best only 
6937	From the best 
6938	And do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe
6939	age 
6941	I choose only those of ripe age 
6942	And if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would
6943	greatly deteriorate 
6945	Certainly 
6946	And the same of horses and animals in general 
6947	Undoubtedly 
6948	Good heavens my dear friend I said what consummate skill will our
6949	rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species 
6951	Certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any
6952	particular skill 
6954	Because I said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body
6955	corporate with medicines Now you know that when patients do not require
6956	medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort
6957	of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has
6958	to be given then the doctor should be more of a man 
6960	That is quite true he said but to what are you alluding 
6962	I mean I replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of
6963	falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we
6964	were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines
6965	might be of advantage 
6967	And we were very right 
6968	And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the
6969	regulations of marriages and births 
6971	How so 
6972	Why I said the principle has been already laid down that the best
6973	of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior
6974	with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear
6975	the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the
6976	flock is to be maintained in first rate condition Now these goings
6977	on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a
6978	further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking
6979	out into rebellion 
6981	Very true 
6982	Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring
6983	together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered
6984	and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings
6985	is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose
6986	aim will be to preserve the average of population There are many
6987	other things which they will have to consider such as the effects
6988	of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as
6989	this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large
6990	or too small 
6992	Certainly he replied 
6993	We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less
6994	worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and
6995	then they will accuse their own ill luck and not the rulers 
6997	To be sure he said 
6998	And I think that our braver and better youth besides their other
6999	honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse
7000	with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers
7001	ought to have as many sons as possible 
7003	True 
7004	And the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices
7005	are to be held by women as well as by men 
7007	Yes 
7008	The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to
7009	the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses
7010	who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior 
7011	or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away
7012	in some mysterious unknown place as they should be 
7014	Yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to
7015	be kept pure 
7017	They will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to
7018	the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible
7019	care that no mother recognizes her own child and other wet nurses
7020	may be engaged if more are required Care will also be taken that
7021	the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the
7022	mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will
7023	hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants 
7025	You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of
7026	it when they are having children 
7028	Why said I and so they ought Let us however proceed with our
7029	scheme We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of
7030	life 
7032	Very true 
7033	And what is the prime of life May it not be defined as a period of
7034	about twenty years in a woman s life and thirty in a man s 
7036	Which years do you mean to include 
7037	A woman I said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children
7038	to the State and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin
7039	at five and twenty when he has passed the point at which the pulse
7040	of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be
7041	fifty five 
7043	Certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime
7044	of physical as well as of intellectual vigour 
7046	Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public
7047	hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing 
7048	the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will
7049	have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and
7050	prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole
7051	city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful
7052	than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the
7053	offspring of darkness and strange lust 
7055	Very true he replied 
7056	And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed
7057	age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without
7058	the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up
7059	a bastard to the State uncertified and unconsecrated 
7061	Very true he replied 
7062	This applies however only to those who are within the specified
7063	age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man
7064	may not marry his daughter or his daughter s daughter or his mother
7065	or his mother s mother and women on the other hand are prohibited
7066	from marrying their sons or fathers or son s son or father s father 
7067	and so on in either direction And we grant all this accompanying
7068	the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may
7069	come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the
7070	birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union
7071	cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly 
7073	That also he said is a reasonable proposition But how will they
7074	know who are fathers and daughters and so on 
7076	They will never know The way will be this dating from the day
7077	of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all
7078	the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards
7079	his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call
7080	him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and
7081	they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers 
7082	All who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came
7083	together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as
7084	I was saying will be forbidden to inter marry This however is
7085	not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of
7086	brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the
7087	sanction of the Pythian oracle the law will allow them 
7089	Quite right he replied 
7090	Such is the scheme Glaucon according to which the guardians of our
7091	State are to have their wives and families in common And now you
7092	would have the argument show that this community is consistent with
7093	the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would
7094	you not 
7096	Yes certainly 
7097	Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought
7098	to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization
7099	of a State what is the greatest I good and what is the greatest
7100	evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp
7101	of the good or of the evil 
7103	By all means 
7104	Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality
7105	where unity ought to reign or any greater good than the bond of unity 
7107	There cannot 
7108	And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains
7109	 where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions
7110	of joy and sorrow 
7112	No doubt 
7113	Yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a State
7114	is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and
7115	the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city
7116	or the citizens 
7118	Certainly 
7119	Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use
7120	of the terms mine and not mine his and not his 
7122	Exactly so 
7123	And is not that the best ordered State in which the greatest number
7124	of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to
7125	the same thing 
7127	Quite true 
7128	Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
7129	individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt 
7130	the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one
7131	kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes
7132	all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a
7133	pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other
7134	part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of
7135	pleasure at the alleviation of suffering 
7137	Very true he replied and I agree with you that in the best ordered
7138	State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you
7139	describe 
7141	Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the
7142	whole State will make his case their own and will either rejoice
7143	or sorrow with him 
7145	Yes he said that is what will happen in a well ordered State 
7147	It will now be time I said for us to return to our State and see
7148	whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental
7149	principles 
7151	Very good 
7152	Our State like every other has rulers and subjects 
7153	True 
7154	All of whom will call one another citizens 
7155	Of course 
7156	But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in
7157	other States 
7159	Generally they call them masters but in democratic States they simply
7160	call them rulers 
7162	And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people
7163	give the rulers 
7165	They are called saviours and helpers he replied 
7166	And what do the rulers call the people 
7167	Their maintainers and foster fathers 
7168	And what do they call them in other States 
7169	Slaves 
7170	And what do the rulers call one another in other States 
7172	Fellow rulers 
7173	And what in ours 
7174	Fellow guardians 
7175	Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would
7176	speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not
7177	being his friend 
7179	Yes very often 
7180	And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest 
7181	and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest 
7183	Exactly 
7184	But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian
7185	as a stranger 
7187	Certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded
7188	by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son
7189	or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected
7190	with him 
7192	Capital I said but let me ask you once more Shall they be a family
7193	in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name 
7194	For example in the use of the word father would the care of a
7195	father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience
7196	to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties
7197	to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely
7198	to receive much good either at the hands of God or of man Are these
7199	to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated
7200	in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to
7201	them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk 
7203	These he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than
7204	for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and
7205	not to act in the spirit of them 
7207	Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more
7208	often beard than in any other As I was describing before when any
7209	one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well 
7210	or it is ill 
7212	Most true 
7213	And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying
7214	that they will have their pleasures and pains in common 
7216	Yes and so they will 
7217	And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they
7218	will alike call my own and having this common interest they will
7219	have a common feeling of pleasure and pain 
7221	Yes far more so than in other States 
7222	And the reason of this over and above the general constitution of
7223	the State will be that the guardians will have a community of women
7224	and children 
7226	That will be the chief reason 
7227	And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as
7228	was implied in our own comparison of a well ordered State to the relation
7229	of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain 
7231	That we acknowledged and very rightly 
7232	Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
7233	the source of the greatest good to the State 
7235	Certainly 
7236	And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming 
7237	 that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other
7238	property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive
7239	from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses 
7240	for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians 
7242	Right he replied 
7243	Both the community of property and the community of families as I
7244	am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear
7245	the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each
7246	man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house
7247	of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private
7248	pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by
7249	the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about
7250	what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards
7251	a common end 
7253	Certainly he replied 
7254	And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their
7255	own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they
7256	will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children
7257	or relations are the occasion 
7259	Of course they will 
7260	Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur
7261	among them For that equals should defend themselves against equals
7262	we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection
7263	of the person a matter of necessity 
7265	That is good he said 
7266	Yes and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man has
7267	a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there 
7268	and not proceed to more dangerous lengths 
7270	Certainly 
7271	To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the
7272	younger 
7274	Clearly 
7275	Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any
7276	other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor
7277	will he slight him in any way For there are two guardians shame
7278	and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from
7279	laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents 
7280	fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are
7281	his brothers sons one wi fathers 
7283	That is true he replied 
7284	Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace
7285	with one another 
7287	Yes there will be no want of peace 
7288	And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will
7289	be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against
7290	them or against one another 
7292	None whatever 
7293	I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they
7294	will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the
7295	flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which
7296	men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy
7297	necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting
7298	how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves
7299	to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this
7300	way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of 
7302	Yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that 
7304	And from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will
7305	be blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed 
7307	How so 
7308	The Olympic victor I said is deemed happy in receiving a part only
7309	of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won
7310	a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the
7311	public cost For the victory which they have won is the salvation
7312	of the whole State and the crown with which they and their children
7313	are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards
7314	from the hands of their country while living and after death have
7315	an honourable burial 
7317	Yes he said and glorious rewards they are 
7318	Do you remember I said how in the course of the previous discussion
7319	some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians
7320	unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all things to
7321	whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter
7322	consider this question but that as at present advised we would
7323	make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the
7324	State with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular
7325	class but of the whole 
7327	Yes I remember 
7328	And what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out
7329	to be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors is the
7330	life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be
7331	compared with it 
7333	Certainly not 
7334	At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere 
7335	that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner
7336	that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this
7337	safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives
7338	the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which
7339	gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole State to
7340	himself then he will have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke when
7341	he said half is more than the whole 
7343	If he were to consult me I should say to him Stay where you are 
7344	when you have the offer of such a life 
7346	You agree then I said that men and women are to have a common way
7347	of life such as we have described common education common children 
7348	and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding
7349	in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together 
7350	and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far
7351	as they are able women are to share with the men And in so doing
7352	they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the
7353	natural relation of the sexes 
7355	I agree with you he replied 
7356	The enquiry I said has yet to be made whether such a community
7357	be found possible as among other animals so also among men and
7358	if possible in what way possible 
7360	You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest 
7362	There is no difficulty I said in seeing how war will be carried
7363	on by them 
7365	How 
7366	Why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take
7367	with them any of their children who are strong enough that after
7368	the manner of the artisan s child they may look on at the work which
7369	they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on
7370	they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their
7371	fathers and mothers Did you never observe in the arts how the potters 
7372	boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel 
7374	Yes I have 
7375	And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and
7376	in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties
7377	than our guardians will be 
7379	The idea is ridiculous he said 
7380	There is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other
7381	animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive
7382	to valour 
7384	That is quite true Socrates and yet if they are defeated which
7385	may often happen in war how great the danger is the children will
7386	be lost as well as their parents and the State will never recover 
7388	True I said but would you never allow them to run any risk 
7390	I am far from saying that 
7391	Well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on
7392	some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better
7393	for it 
7395	Clearly 
7396	Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their
7397	youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk
7398	may fairly be incurred 
7400	Yes very important 
7401	This then must be our first step to make our children spectators
7402	of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against
7403	danger then all will be well 
7405	True 
7406	Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war 
7407	but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe
7408	and what dangerous 
7410	That may be assumed 
7411	And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about
7412	the dangerous ones 
7414	True 
7415	And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans
7416	who will be their leaders and teachers 
7418	Very properly 
7419	Still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good
7420	deal of chance about them 
7422	True 
7423	Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with
7424	wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape 
7426	What do you mean he said 
7427	I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth 
7428	and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war 
7429	the horses must be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and
7430	yet the swiftest that can be had In this way they will get an excellent
7431	view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is
7432	danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape 
7434	I believe that you are right he said 
7435	Next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to
7436	one another and to their enemies I should be inclined to propose
7437	that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is
7438	guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the
7439	rank of a husbandman or artisan What do you think 
7441	By all means I should say 
7442	And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made
7443	a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them
7444	do what they like with him 
7446	Certainly 
7447	But the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to
7448	him In the first place he shall receive honour in the army from
7449	his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown
7450	him What do you say 
7452	I approve 
7453	And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship 
7455	To that too I agree 
7456	But you will hardly agree to my next proposal 
7457	What is your proposal 
7458	That he should kiss and be kissed by them 
7459	Most certainly and I should be disposed to go further and say Let
7460	no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while
7461	the expedition lasts So that if there be a lover in the army whether
7462	his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize
7463	of valour 
7465	Capital I said That the brave man is to have more wives than others
7466	has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such
7467	matters more than others in order that he may have as many children
7468	as possible 
7470	Agreed 
7471	Again there is another manner in which according to Homer brave
7472	youths should be honoured for he tells how Ajax after he had distinguished
7473	himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be
7474	a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being
7475	not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing 
7477	Most true he said 
7478	Then in this I said Homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices
7479	and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the
7480	measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those
7481	other distinctions which we were mentioning also with 
7483	seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them 
7484	we shall be at the same time training them 
7486	That he replied is excellent 
7487	Yes I said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say 
7488	in the first place that he is of the golden race 
7490	To be sure 
7491	Nay have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they
7492	are dead 
7494	They are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of
7495	evil the guardians of speech gifted men 
7497	Yes and we accept his authority 
7498	We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine
7499	and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction
7500	and we must do as he bids 
7502	By all means 
7503	And in ages to come we will reverence them and knee before their
7504	sepulchres as at the graves of heroes And not only they but any who
7505	are deemed pre eminently good whether they die from age or in any
7506	other way shall be admitted to the same honours 
7508	That is very right he said 
7509	Next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies What about this 
7511	In what respect do you mean 
7512	First of all in regard to slavery Do you think it right that Hellenes
7513	should enslave Hellenic States or allow others to enslave them if
7514	they can help Should not their custom be to spare them considering
7515	the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under
7516	the yoke of the barbarians 
7518	To spare them is infinitely better 
7519	Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule
7520	which they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe 
7522	Certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians
7523	and will keep their hands off one another 
7525	Next as to the slain ought the conquerors I said to take anything
7526	but their armour Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford
7527	an excuse for not facing the battle Cowards skulk about the dead 
7528	pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before
7529	now has been lost from this love of plunder 
7531	Very true 
7532	And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and
7533	also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the
7534	dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting
7535	gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at
7536	his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead 
7538	Very like a dog he said 
7539	Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial 
7541	Yes he replied we most certainly must 
7542	Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of
7543	all the arms of Hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with
7544	other Hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering
7545	of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by
7546	the god himself 
7548	Very true 
7549	Again as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning
7550	of houses what is to be the practice 
7552	May I have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion 
7554	Both should be forbidden in my judgment I would take the annual
7555	produce and no more Shall I tell you why 
7557	Pray do 
7558	Why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war 
7559	and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the
7560	one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what
7561	is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord 
7562	and only the second war 
7564	That is a very proper distinction he replied 
7565	And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race
7566	is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien
7567	and strange to the barbarians 
7569	Very good he said 
7570	And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with
7571	Hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight 
7572	and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called
7573	war but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas
7574	is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends
7575	and such enmity is to be called discord 
7577	I agree 
7578	Consider then I said when that which we have acknowledged to be
7579	discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the
7580	lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife
7581	appear No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in
7582	pieces his own nurse and mother There might be reason in the conqueror
7583	depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have
7584	the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting
7585	for ever 
7587	Yes he said that is a better temper than the other 
7588	And will not the city which you are founding be an Hellenic city 
7590	It ought to be he replied 
7591	Then will not the citizens be good and civilized 
7592	Yes very civilized 
7593	And will they not be lovers of Hellas and think of Hellas as their
7594	own land and share in the common temples 
7596	Most certainly 
7597	And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them
7598	as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called
7599	a war 
7601	Certainly not 
7602	Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled 
7603	Certainly 
7605	They will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy
7606	their opponents they will be correctors not enemies 
7608	Just so 
7609	And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas 
7610	nor will they burn houses not even suppose that the whole population
7611	of a city men women and children are equally their enemies 
7612	for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons
7613	and that the many are their friends And for all these reasons they
7614	will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses their
7615	enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have
7616	compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction 
7618	I agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic
7619	enemies and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another 
7621	Then let us enact this law also for our guardians that they are neither
7622	to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses 
7624	Agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these all our previous
7625	enactments are very good 
7627	But still I must say Socrates that if you are allowed to go on in
7628	this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the
7629	commencement of this discussion you thrust aside Is such an order
7630	of things possible and how if at all For I am quite ready to acknowledge
7631	that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts
7632	of good to the State I will add what you have omitted that your
7633	citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their
7634	ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the
7635	other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their
7636	armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror
7637	to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need I know that they
7638	will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic tic
7639	advantages which might also be mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge 
7640	but as I admit all these advantages and as many more as you please 
7641	if only this State of yours were to come into existence we need say
7642	no more about them assuming then the existence of the State let
7643	us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the
7644	rest may be left 
7646	If I loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me I said 
7647	and have no mercy I have hardly escaped the first and second waves 
7648	and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the
7649	third which is the greatest and heaviest When you have seen and
7650	heard the third wave I think you be more considerate and will acknowledge
7651	that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so
7652	extraordinary as that which I have now to state and investigate 
7654	The more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined
7655	are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible speak
7656	out and at once 
7658	Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the
7659	search after justice and injustice 
7661	True he replied but what of that 
7662	I was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are
7663	to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice 
7664	or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in
7665	him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men 
7667	The approximation will be enough 
7668	We are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the
7669	character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly
7670	unjust that we might have an ideal We were to look at these in order
7671	that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according
7672	to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled
7673	them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact 
7675	True he said 
7676	Would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated
7677	with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was
7678	unable to show that any such man could ever have existed 
7680	He would be none the worse 
7681	Well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State 
7683	To be sure 
7684	And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the
7685	possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described 
7687	Surely not he replied 
7688	That is the truth I said But if at your request I am to try and
7689	show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest I must
7690	ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions 
7692	What admissions 
7693	I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language 
7694	Does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual 
7695	whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short
7696	of the truth What do you say 
7698	I agree 
7699	Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will
7700	in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover
7701	how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that
7702	we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented 
7703	I am sure that I should be contented will not you 
7705	Yes I will 
7706	Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is
7707	the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least
7708	change which will enable a State to pass into the truer form and
7709	let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two 
7710	at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible 
7712	Certainly he replied 
7713	I think I said that there might be a reform of the State if only
7714	one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a
7715	possible one 
7717	What is it he said 
7718	Now then I said I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest
7719	of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break
7720	and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words 
7722	Proceed 
7723	I said Until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of
7724	this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political
7725	greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue
7726	either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside 
7727	cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race 
7728	as I believe and then only will this our State have a possibility
7729	of life and behold the light of day Such was the thought my dear
7730	Glaucon which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too
7731	extravagant for to be convinced that in no other State can there
7732	be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing 
7734	Socrates what do you mean I would have you consider that the word
7735	which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very
7736	respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in
7737	a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you
7738	might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven
7739	knows what and if you don t prepare an answer and put yourself in
7740	motion you will be prepared by their fine wits and no mistake 
7742	You got me into the scrape I said 
7743	And I was quite right however I will do all I can to get you out
7744	of it but I can only give you good will and good advice and perhaps 
7745	I may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another
7746	 that is all And now having such an auxiliary you must do your
7747	best to show the unbelievers that you are right 
7749	I ought to try I said since you offer me such invaluable assistance 
7750	And I think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must
7751	explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to
7752	rule in the State then we shall be able to defend ourselves There
7753	will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy
7754	and to be leaders in the State and others who are not born to be
7755	philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders 
7757	Then now for a definition he said 
7758	Follow me I said and I hope that I may in some way or other be able
7759	to give you a satisfactory explanation 
7761	Proceed 
7762	I dare say that you remember and therefore I need not remind you 
7763	that a lover if lie is worthy of the name ought to show his love 
7764	not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole 
7766	I really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my
7767	memory 
7769	Another person I said might fairly reply as you do but a man of
7770	pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower
7771	of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover s
7772	breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards 
7773	Is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose 
7774	and you praise his charming face the hook nose of another has you
7775	say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the
7776	grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children
7777	of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called 
7778	what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives 
7779	and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth 
7780	In a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing
7781	which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that
7782	blooms in the spring time of youth 
7784	If you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the
7785	argument I assent 
7787	And what do you say of lovers of wine Do you not see them doing the
7788	same They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine 
7790	Very good 
7791	And the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army 
7792	they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured
7793	by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured
7794	by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have 
7796	Exactly 
7797	Once more let me ask Does he who desires any class of goods desire
7798	the whole class or a part only 
7800	The whole 
7801	And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a
7802	part of wisdom only but of the whole 
7804	Yes of the whole 
7805	And he who dislikes learnings especially in youth when he has no
7806	power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain
7807	not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses
7808	his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and
7809	not a good one 
7811	Very true he said 
7812	Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is
7813	curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher 
7814	Am I not right 
7816	Glaucon said If curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many
7817	a strange being will have a title to the name All the lovers of sights
7818	have a delight in learning and must therefore be included Musical
7819	amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers 
7820	for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything
7821	like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run
7822	about at the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears
7823	to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country
7824	 that makes no difference they are there Now are we to maintain
7825	that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors
7826	of quite minor arts are philosophers 
7828	Certainly not I replied they are only an imitation 
7829	He said Who then are the true philosophers 
7830	Those I said who are lovers of the vision of truth 
7831	That is also good he said but I should like to know what you mean 
7833	To another I replied I might have a difficulty in explaining but
7834	I am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make 
7836	What is the proposition 
7837	That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two 
7839	Certainly 
7840	And inasmuch as they are two each of them is one 
7841	True again 
7842	And of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the
7843	same remark holds taken singly each of them one but from the various
7844	combinations of them with actions and things and with one another 
7845	they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many Very true 
7847	And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight loving 
7848	art loving practical class and those of whom I am speaking and who
7849	are alone worthy of the name of philosophers 
7851	How do you distinguish them he said 
7852	The lovers of sounds and sights I replied are as I conceive fond
7853	of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products
7854	that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or
7855	loving absolute beauty 
7857	True he replied 
7858	Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this 
7860	Very true 
7861	And he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
7862	beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty
7863	is unable to follow of such an one I ask Is he awake or in a dream
7864	only Reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens
7865	dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object 
7867	I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming 
7868	But take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute
7869	beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
7870	participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place
7871	of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer 
7872	or is he awake 
7874	He is wide awake 
7875	And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge 
7876	and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion
7878	Certainly 
7879	But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
7880	statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him 
7881	without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits 
7883	We must certainly offer him some good advice he replied 
7885	Come then and let us think of something to say to him Shall we
7886	begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he
7887	may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it But we should
7888	like to ask him a question Does he who has knowledge know something
7889	or nothing You must answer for him 
7891	I answer that he knows something 
7892	Something that is or is not 
7893	Something that is for how can that which is not ever be known 
7895	And are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of
7896	view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that
7897	the utterly non existent is utterly unknown 
7899	Nothing can be more certain 
7900	Good But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be
7901	and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being
7902	and the absolute negation of being 
7904	Yes between them 
7905	And as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity
7906	to not being for that intermediate between being and not being there
7907	has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance
7908	and knowledge if there be such 
7910	Certainly 
7911	Do we admit the existence of opinion 
7912	Undoubtedly 
7913	As being the same with knowledge or another faculty 
7914	Another faculty 
7915	Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
7916	corresponding to this difference of faculties 
7918	Yes 
7919	And knowledge is relative to being and knows being But before I proceed
7920	further I will make a division 
7922	What division 
7923	I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are
7924	powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do Sight
7925	and hearing for example I should call faculties Have I clearly
7926	explained the class which I mean 
7928	Yes I quite understand 
7929	Then let me tell you my view about them I do not see them and therefore
7930	the distinctions of fire colour and the like which enable me to
7931	discern the differences of some things do not apply to them In speaking
7932	of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result and that which
7933	has the same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty but
7934	that which has another sphere and another result I call different 
7935	Would that be your way of speaking 
7937	Yes 
7938	And will you be so very good as to answer one more question Would
7939	you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place
7940	it 
7942	Certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties 
7944	And is opinion also a faculty 
7945	Certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to
7946	form an opinion 
7948	And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is
7949	not the same as opinion 
7951	Why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that
7952	which is infallible with that which errs 
7954	An excellent answer proving I said that we are quite conscious
7955	of a distinction between them 
7957	Yes 
7958	Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
7959	spheres or subject matters 
7961	That is certain 
7962	Being is the sphere or subject matter of knowledge and knowledge
7963	is to know the nature of being 
7965	Yes 
7966	And opinion is to have an opinion 
7967	Yes 
7968	And do we know what we opine or is the subject matter of opinion
7969	the same as the subject matter of knowledge 
7971	Nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in
7972	faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if 
7973	as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then
7974	the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same 
7976	Then if being is the subject matter of knowledge something else must
7977	be the subject matter of opinion 
7979	Yes something else 
7980	Well then is not being the subject matter of opinion or rather 
7981	how can there be an opinion at all about not being Reflect when
7982	a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something Can he
7983	have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing 
7985	Impossible 
7986	He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing 
7988	Yes 
7989	And not being is not one thing but properly speaking nothing 
7991	True 
7992	Of not being ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative 
7993	of being knowledge 
7995	True he said 
7996	Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not being 
7998	Not with either 
7999	And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge 
8000	That seems to be true 
8001	But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in
8002	a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than
8003	ignorance 
8005	In neither 
8006	Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge 
8007	but lighter than ignorance 
8009	Both and in no small degree 
8010	And also to be within and between them 
8011	Yes 
8012	Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate 
8013	No question 
8014	But were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of
8015	a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would
8016	appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute
8017	not being and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge
8018	nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them 
8020	True 
8021	And in that interval there has now been discovered something which
8022	we call opinion 
8024	There has 
8025	Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
8026	of the nature of being and not being and cannot rightly be termed
8027	either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may
8028	truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to its proper faculty 
8029	 the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the
8030	faculty of the mean 
8032	True 
8033	This being premised I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
8034	there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion
8035	the beautiful is the manifold he I say your lover of beautiful
8036	sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and
8037	the just is one or that anything is one to him I would appeal 
8038	saying Will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all
8039	these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly 
8040	or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which
8041	will not also be unholy 
8043	No he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found
8044	ugly and the same is true of the rest 
8046	And may not the many which are doubles be also halves doubles 
8047	that is of one thing and halves of another 
8049	Quite true 
8050	And things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will
8051	not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names 
8053	True both these and the opposite names will always attach to all
8054	of them 
8056	And can any one of those many things which are called by particular
8057	names be said to be this rather than not to be this 
8059	He replied They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts
8060	or the children s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with
8061	what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat
8062	was sitting The individual objects of which I am speaking are also
8063	a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind 
8064	either as being or not being or both or neither 
8066	Then what will you do with them I said Can they have a better place
8067	than between being and not being For they are clearly not in greater
8068	darkness or negation than not being or more full of light and existence
8069	than being 
8071	That is quite true he said 
8072	Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
8073	multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things
8074	are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being
8075	and pure not being 
8077	We have 
8078	Yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we
8079	might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter
8080	of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained
8081	by the intermediate faculty 
8083	Quite true 
8084	Then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute
8085	beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see
8086	the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons
8087	may be said to have opinion but not knowledge 
8089	That is certain 
8090	But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said
8091	to know and not to have opinion only 
8093	Neither can that be denied 
8094	The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge the other those
8095	of opinion The latter are the same as I dare say will remember 
8096	who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would
8097	not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty 
8099	Yes I remember 
8100	Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers
8101	of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry
8102	with us for thus describing them 
8104	I shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what
8105	is true 
8107	But those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers
8108	of wisdom and not lovers of opinion 
8110	Assuredly 
8112	 
8114	BOOK VI
8116	Socrates GLAUCON 
8118	And thus Glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true
8119	and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view 
8121	I do not think he said that the way could have been shortened 
8123	I suppose not I said and yet I believe that we might have had a
8124	better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined
8125	to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting
8126	us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just
8127	differs from that of the unjust must consider 
8129	And what is the next question he asked 
8130	Surely I said the one which follows next in order Inasmuch as philosophers
8131	only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who
8132	wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers 
8133	I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our
8134	State 
8136	And how can we rightly answer that question 
8137	Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions
8138	of our State let them be our guardians 
8140	Very good 
8141	Neither I said can there be any question that the guardian who is
8142	to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes 
8144	There can be no question of that 
8145	And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge
8146	of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear
8147	pattern and are unable as with a painter s eye to look at the absolute
8148	truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of
8149	the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice
8150	in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order
8151	of them are not such persons I ask simply blind 
8153	Truly he replied they are much in that condition 
8154	And shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides
8155	being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular
8156	of virtue also know the very truth of each thing 
8158	There can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this
8159	greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place
8160	unless they fail in some other respect 
8162	Suppose then I said that we determine how far they can unite this
8163	and the other excellences 
8165	By all means 
8166	In the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher
8167	has to be ascertained We must come to an understanding about him 
8168	and when we have done so then if I am not mistaken we shall also
8169	acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that
8170	those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in
8171	the State 
8173	What do you mean 
8174	Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a
8175	sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation
8176	and corruption 
8178	Agreed 
8179	And further I said let us agree that they are lovers of all true
8180	being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable 
8181	which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover
8182	and the man of ambition 
8184	True 
8185	And if they are to be what we were describing is there not another
8186	quality which they should also possess 
8188	What quality 
8189	Truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind
8190	falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth 
8192	Yes that may be safely affirmed of them 
8193	 May be my friend I replied is not the word say rather must
8194	be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help
8195	loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections 
8197	Right he said 
8198	And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth 
8199	How can there be 
8200	Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood 
8202	Never 
8203	The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far
8204	as in him lies desire all truth 
8206	Assuredly 
8207	But then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong
8208	in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like
8209	a stream which has been drawn off into another channel 
8211	True 
8212	He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
8213	absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily
8214	pleasure I mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one 
8216	That is most certain 
8217	Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for
8218	the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending 
8219	have no place in his character 
8221	Very true 
8222	Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered 
8224	What is that 
8225	There should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can more
8226	antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the
8227	whole of things both divine and human 
8229	Most true he replied 
8230	Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator
8231	of all time and all existence think much of human life 
8233	He cannot 
8234	Or can such an one account death fearful 
8235	No indeed 
8236	Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy 
8238	Certainly not 
8239	Or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous
8240	or mean or a boaster or a coward can he I say ever be unjust or
8241	hard in his dealings 
8243	Impossible 
8244	Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude
8245	and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth
8246	the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical 
8248	True 
8249	There is another point which should be remarked 
8250	What point 
8251	Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will
8252	love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes
8253	little progress 
8255	Certainly not 
8256	And again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns 
8257	will he not be an empty vessel 
8259	That is certain 
8260	Labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless
8261	occupation Yes 
8263	Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic
8264	natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory 
8266	Certainly 
8267	And once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend
8268	to disproportion 
8270	Undoubtedly 
8271	And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion 
8273	To proportion 
8274	Then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally well proportioned
8275	and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true
8276	being of everything 
8278	Certainly 
8279	Well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating 
8280	go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which
8281	is to have a full and perfect participation of being 
8283	They are absolutely necessary he replied 
8284	And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who
8285	has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious 
8286	the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred 
8288	The god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such
8289	a study 
8291	And to men like him I said when perfected by years and education 
8292	and to these only you will entrust the State 
8294	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
8296	Here Adeimantus interposed and said To these statements Socrates 
8297	no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange
8298	feeling passes over the minds of your hearers They fancy that they
8299	are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their
8300	own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles
8301	accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have
8302	sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to
8303	be turned upside down And as unskilful players of draughts are at
8304	last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to
8305	move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing
8306	to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all
8307	the time they are in the right The observation is suggested to me
8308	by what is now occurring For any one of us might say that although
8309	in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument 
8310	he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry
8311	on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the
8312	pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters 
8313	not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the
8314	best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which
8315	you extol 
8317	Well and do you think that those who say so are wrong 
8318	I cannot tell he replied but I should like to know what is your
8319	opinion 
8321	Hear my answer I am of opinion that they are quite right 
8323	Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease
8324	from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged
8325	by us to be of no use to them 
8327	You ask a question I said to which a reply can only be given in
8328	a parable 
8330	Yes Socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not
8331	at all accustomed I suppose 
8333	I perceive I said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me
8334	into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then
8335	you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination 
8336	for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own States
8337	is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it 
8338	and therefore if I am to plead their cause I must have recourse
8339	to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like
8340	the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures 
8341	Imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is
8342	taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf
8343	and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation
8344	is not much better The sailors are quarrelling with one another about
8345	the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer 
8346	though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell
8347	who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it
8348	cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who
8349	says the contrary They throng about the captain begging and praying
8350	him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail 
8351	but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them
8352	overboard and having first chained up the noble captain s senses
8353	with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession
8354	of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking 
8355	they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected
8356	of them Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their
8357	plot for getting the ship out of the captain s hands into their own
8358	whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor 
8359	pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call
8360	a good for nothing but that the true pilot must pay attention to
8361	the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else
8362	belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command
8363	of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other
8364	people like or not the possibility of this union of authority with
8365	the steerer s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts
8366	or been made part of their calling Now in vessels which are in a
8367	state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true
8368	pilot be regarded Will he not be called by them a prater a star gazer 
8369	a good for nothing 
8371	Of course said Adeimantus 
8372	Then you will hardly need I said to hear the interpretation of the
8373	figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the
8374	State for you understand already 
8376	Certainly 
8377	Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised
8378	at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain
8379	it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be
8380	far more extraordinary 
8382	I will 
8383	Say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be
8384	useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to
8385	attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use
8386	them and not to themselves The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors
8387	to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither
8388	are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author
8389	of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is
8390	ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and
8391	he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern The ruler
8392	who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled
8393	by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different
8394	stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the
8395	true helmsmen to those who are called by them good for nothings and
8396	star gazers 
8398	Precisely so he said 
8399	For these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest
8400	pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
8401	opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is
8402	done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers 
8403	the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater
8404	number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which
8405	opinion I agreed 
8407	Yes 
8408	And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained 
8410	True 
8411	Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority
8412	is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge
8413	of philosophy any more than the other 
8415	By all means 
8416	And let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description
8417	of the gentle and noble nature Truth as you will remember was his
8418	leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this 
8419	he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy 
8421	Yes that was said 
8422	Well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at
8423	variance with present notions of him 
8425	Certainly he said 
8426	And have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover
8427	of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature 
8428	he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance
8429	only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the
8430	force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of
8431	the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power
8432	in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming
8433	incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will
8434	have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till
8435	then will he cease from his travail 
8437	Nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him 
8439	And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher s nature 
8440	Will he not utterly hate a lie 
8442	He will 
8443	And when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band
8444	which he leads 
8446	Impossible 
8447	Justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance
8448	will follow after 
8450	True he replied 
8451	Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the philosopher s
8452	virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence 
8453	apprehension memory were his natural gifts And you objected that 
8454	although no one could deny what I then said still if you leave words
8455	and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of
8456	them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved 
8457	we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations 
8458	and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad 
8459	which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and
8460	definition of the true philosopher 
8462	Exactly 
8463	And we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature why so
8464	many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling I am speaking of those
8465	who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done
8466	with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner
8467	of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them
8468	and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies 
8469	bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation
8470	of which we speak 
8472	What are these corruptions he said 
8473	I will see if I can explain them to you Every one will admit that
8474	a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required
8475	in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men 
8477	Rare indeed 
8478	And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare
8479	natures 
8481	What causes 
8482	In the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance 
8483	and the rest of them every one of which praise worthy qualities and
8484	this is a most singular circumstance destroys and distracts from
8485	philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them 
8487	That is very singular he replied 
8488	Then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength 
8489	rank and great connections in the State you understand the sort
8490	of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect 
8492	I understand but I should like to know more precisely what you mean
8493	about them 
8495	Grasp the truth as a whole I said and in the right way you will
8496	then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and
8497	they will no longer appear strange to you 
8499	And how am I to do so he asked 
8500	Why I said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or
8501	animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or
8502	soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to
8503	the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to
8504	what is good than what is not 
8506	Very true 
8507	There is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien
8508	conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast
8509	is greater 
8511	Certainly 
8512	And may we not say Adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they
8513	are ill educated become pre eminently bad Do not great crimes and
8514	the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by
8515	education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are
8516	scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil 
8518	There I think that you are right 
8519	And our philosopher follows the same analogy he is like a plant which 
8520	having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue 
8521	but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious
8522	of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power Do you
8523	really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted
8524	by Sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any
8525	degree worth speaking of Are not the public who say these things
8526	the greatest of all Sophists And do they not educate to perfection
8527	young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own
8528	hearts 
8530	When is this accomplished he said 
8531	When they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or
8532	in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular
8533	resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which
8534	are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating
8535	both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks
8536	and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the
8537	praise or blame at such a time will not a young man s heart as
8538	they say leap within him Will any private training enable him to
8539	stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion or will
8540	he be carried away by the stream Will he not have the notions of
8541	good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they
8542	do and as they are such will he be 
8544	Yes Socrates necessity will compel him 
8545	And yet I said there is a still greater necessity which has not
8546	been mentioned 
8548	What is that 
8549	The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you
8550	are aware these new Sophists and educators who are the public apply
8551	when their words are powerless 
8553	Indeed they do and in right good earnest 
8554	Now what opinion of any other Sophist or of any private person can
8555	be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest 
8557	None he replied 
8558	No indeed I said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly 
8559	there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different
8560	type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that
8561	which is supplied by public opinion I speak my friend of human
8562	virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not
8563	included for I would not have you ignorant that in the present evil
8564	state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved
8565	by the power of God as we may truly say 
8567	I quite assent he replied 
8568	Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation 
8570	What are you going to say 
8571	Why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call Sophists
8572	and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing
8573	but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their
8574	assemblies and this is their wisdom I might compare them to a man
8575	who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast
8576	who is fed by him he would learn how to approach and handle him also
8577	at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse 
8578	and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds 
8579	when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may
8580	suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he
8581	has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and
8582	makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although
8583	he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions
8584	of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable 
8585	or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes
8586	and tempers of the great brute Good he pronounces to be that in which
8587	the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can
8588	give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the
8589	necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining
8590	to others the nature of either or the difference between them which
8591	is immense By heaven would not such an one be a rare educator 
8593	Indeed he would 
8594	And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment
8595	of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting
8596	or music or finally in politics differ from him whom I have been
8597	describing For when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to
8598	them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done
8599	the State making them his judges when he is not obliged the so called
8600	necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise 
8601	And yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation
8602	of their own notions about the honourable and good Did you ever hear
8603	any of them which were not 
8605	No nor am I likely to hear 
8606	You recognise the truth of what I have been saying Then let me ask
8607	you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to
8608	believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many
8609	beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many
8610	in each kind 
8612	Certainly not 
8613	Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher 
8614	Impossible 
8615	And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure
8616	of the world 
8618	They must 
8619	And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them 
8621	That is evident 
8622	Then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved
8623	in his calling to the end and remember what we were saying of him 
8624	that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence
8625	 these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher s gifts 
8627	Yes 
8628	Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first
8629	among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental
8630	ones 
8632	Certainly he said 
8633	And his friends and fellow citizens will want to use him as he gets
8634	older for their own purposes 
8636	No question 
8637	Falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour
8638	and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the
8639	power which he will one day possess 
8641	That often happens he said 
8642	And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances 
8643	especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and
8644	a tall proper youth Will he not be full of boundless aspirations 
8645	and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians 
8646	and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate
8647	himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride 
8649	To be sure he will 
8650	Now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to
8651	him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which
8652	can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse
8653	circumstances he will be easily induced to listen 
8655	Far otherwise 
8656	And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
8657	reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and
8658	taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they
8659	think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping
8660	to reap from his companionship Will they not do and say anything
8661	to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his
8662	teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as
8663	public prosecutions 
8665	There can be no doubt of it 
8666	And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher 
8668	Impossible 
8669	Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which
8670	make a man a philosopher may if he be ill educated divert him from
8671	philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other
8672	so called goods of life 
8674	We were quite right 
8675	Thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure
8676	which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best
8677	of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at
8678	any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the
8679	authors of the greatest evil to States and individuals and also of
8680	the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but
8681	a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals
8682	or to States 
8684	That is most true he said 
8685	And so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete 
8686	for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are
8687	leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing
8688	that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour
8689	her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers
8690	utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing 
8691	and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment 
8693	That is certainly what people say 
8694	Yes and what else would you expect I said when you think of the
8695	puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked
8696	with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison
8697	into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy 
8698	those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable
8699	crafts For although philosophy be in this evil case still there
8700	remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts 
8701	And many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and
8702	whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their
8703	bodies are by their trades and crafts Is not this unavoidable 
8705	Yes 
8706	Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out
8707	of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a
8708	new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master s
8709	daughter who is left poor and desolate 
8711	A most exact parallel 
8712	What will be the issue of such marriages Will they not be vile and
8713	bastard 
8715	There can be no question of it 
8716	And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy
8717	and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of
8718	ideas and opinions are likely to be generated Will they not be sophisms
8719	captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy
8720	of or akin to true wisdom 
8722	No doubt he said 
8723	Then Adeimantus I said the worthy disciples of philosophy will
8724	be but a small remnant perchance some noble and well educated person 
8725	detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting
8726	influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean
8727	city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may
8728	be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and
8729	come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by
8730	our friend Theages bridle for everything in the life of Theages
8731	conspired to divert him from philosophy but ill health kept him away
8732	from politics My own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning 
8733	for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man 
8734	Those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed
8735	a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness
8736	of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor
8737	is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and
8738	be saved Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among
8739	wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but
8740	neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and
8741	therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his
8742	friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life
8743	without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace 
8744	and goes his own way He is like one who in the storm of dust and
8745	sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter
8746	of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is
8747	content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or
8748	unrighteousness and depart in peace and good will with bright hopes 
8750	Yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs 
8752	A great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a State suitable
8753	to him for in a State which is suitable to him he will have a larger
8754	growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself 
8756	The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently
8757	explained the injustice of the charges against her has been shown is
8758	there anything more which you wish to say 
8760	Nothing more on that subject he replied but I should like to know
8761	which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted
8762	to her 
8764	Not any of them I said and that is precisely the accusation which
8765	I bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic
8766	nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic
8767	seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is
8768	wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so
8769	this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and
8770	receives another character But if philosophy ever finds in the State
8771	that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is
8772	in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men
8773	or institutions are but human and now I know that you are going
8774	to ask what that State is 
8776	No he said there you are wrong for I was going to ask another question
8777	 whether it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors 
8778	or some other 
8780	Yes I replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying
8781	before that some living authority would always be required in the
8782	State having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when
8783	as legislator you were laying down the laws 
8785	That was said he replied 
8786	Yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing
8787	objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long
8788	and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy 
8790	What is there remaining 
8791	The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not
8792	to be the ruin of the State All great attempts are attended with
8793	risk hard is the good as men say 
8795	Still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will
8796	then be complete 
8798	I shall not be hindered I said by any want of will but if at all 
8799	by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please
8800	to remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly
8801	I declare that States should pursue philosophy not as they do now 
8802	but in a different spirit 
8804	In what manner 
8805	At present I said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning
8806	when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved
8807	from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those
8808	of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when
8809	they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject I mean
8810	dialectic take themselves off In after life when invited by some
8811	one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this
8812	they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be
8813	their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases
8814	they are extinguished more truly than Heracleitus sun inasmuch as
8815	they never light up again 
8817	But what ought to be their course 
8818	Just the opposite In childhood and youth their study and what philosophy
8819	they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period
8820	while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care
8821	should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in
8822	the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins
8823	to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when
8824	the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military
8825	duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour 
8826	as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with
8827	a similar happiness in another 
8829	How truly in earnest you are Socrates he said I am sure of that 
8830	and yet most of your hearers if I am not mistaken are likely to
8831	be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be
8832	convinced Thrasymachus least of all 
8834	Do not make a quarrel I said between Thrasymachus and me who have
8835	recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies 
8836	for I shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him
8837	and other men or do something which may profit them against the day
8838	when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state
8839	of existence 
8841	You are speaking of a time which is not very near 
8842	Rather I replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with
8843	eternity Nevertheless I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe 
8844	for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised 
8845	they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting
8846	of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having
8847	a natural unity But a human being who in word and work is perfectly
8848	moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of
8849	virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they
8850	have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that
8851	they ever did 
8853	No indeed 
8854	No my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble
8855	sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every
8856	means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge 
8857	while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which
8858	the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the
8859	courts of law or in society 
8861	They are strangers he said to the words of which you speak 
8863	And this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced
8864	us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities
8865	nor States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
8866	class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially
8867	compelled whether they will or not to take care of the State and
8868	until a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them or until
8869	kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely
8870	inspired d with a true love of true philosophy That either or both
8871	of these alternatives are impossible I see no reason to affirm if
8872	they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and
8873	visionaries Am I not right 
8875	Quite right 
8876	If then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour
8877	in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected
8878	philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
8879	power to have the charge of the State we are ready to assert to the
8880	death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will
8881	be whenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen There is no impossibility
8882	in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves 
8884	My opinion agrees with yours he said 
8885	But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude 
8887	I should imagine not he replied 
8888	O my friend I said do not attack the multitude they will change
8889	their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with
8890	the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over education 
8891	you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as
8892	you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind
8893	will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed
8894	 if they view him in this new light they will surely change their
8895	notion of him and answer in another strain Who can be at enmity
8896	with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from
8897	envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy Nay let
8898	me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but
8899	not in the majority of mankind 
8901	I quite agree with you he said 
8902	And do you not also think as I do that the harsh feeling which the
8903	many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who
8904	rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault
8905	with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation 
8906	and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this 
8908	It is most unbecoming 
8909	For he Adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely
8910	no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with
8911	malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed
8912	towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring
8913	nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason 
8914	these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform
8915	himself Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential
8916	converse 
8918	Impossible 
8919	And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes
8920	orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every
8921	one else he will suffer from detraction 
8923	Of course 
8924	And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself 
8925	but human nature generally whether in States or individuals into
8926	that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful
8927	artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue 
8929	Anything but unskilful 
8930	And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the
8931	truth will they be angry with philosophy Will they disbelieve us 
8932	when we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed
8933	by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern 
8935	They will not be angry if they understand he said But how will they
8936	draw out the plan of which you are speaking 
8938	They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men from which 
8939	as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean
8940	surface This is no easy task But whether easy or not herein will
8941	lie the difference between them and every other legislator they
8942	will have nothing to do either with individual or State and will
8943	inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made 
8944	a clean surface 
8946	They will be very right he said 
8947	Having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the
8948	constitution 
8950	No doubt 
8951	And when they are filling in the work as I conceive they will often
8952	turn their eyes upwards and downwards I mean that they will first
8953	look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the
8954	human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life
8955	into the image of a man and thus they will conceive according to
8956	that other image which when existing among men Homer calls the
8957	form and likeness of God 
8959	Very true he said 
8960	And one feature they will erase and another they will put in they
8961	have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways
8962	of God 
8964	Indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture 
8966	And now I said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described
8967	as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions
8968	is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant
8969	because to his hands we committed the State and are they growing
8970	a little calmer at what they have just heard 
8972	Much calmer if there is any sense in them 
8973	Why where can they still find any ground for objection Will they
8974	doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being 
8976	They would not be so unreasonable 
8977	Or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the
8978	highest good 
8980	Neither can they doubt this 
8981	But again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable
8982	circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was 
8983	Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected 
8985	Surely not 
8986	Then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers
8987	bear rule States and individuals will have no rest from evil nor
8988	will this our imaginary State ever be realised 
8990	I think that they will be less angry 
8991	Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle 
8992	and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other
8993	reason cannot refuse to come to terms 
8995	By all means he said 
8996	Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected Will
8997	any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes
8998	who are by nature philosophers 
9000	Surely no man he said 
9001	And when they have come into being will any one say that they must
9002	of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied
9003	even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of
9004	them can escape who will venture to affirm this 
9006	Who indeed 
9007	But said I one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient
9008	to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about
9009	which the world is so incredulous 
9011	Yes one is enough 
9012	The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been
9013	describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them 
9015	Certainly 
9016	And that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or
9017	impossibility 
9019	I think not 
9020	But we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this 
9021	if only possible is assuredly for the best 
9023	We have 
9024	And now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would
9025	be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult 
9026	is not impossible 
9028	Very good 
9029	And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject 
9030	but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits
9031	will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages
9032	are they to apply themselves to their several studies 
9034	Certainly 
9035	I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and
9036	the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because
9037	I knew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was
9038	difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much
9039	service to me for I had to discuss them all the same The women and
9040	children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers
9041	must be investigated from the very beginning We were saying as you
9042	will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried
9043	by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor
9044	in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism
9045	 he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure 
9046	like gold tried in the refiner s fire was to be made a ruler and
9047	to receive honours and rewards in life and after death This was the
9048	sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside
9049	and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now
9050	arisen 
9052	I perfectly remember he said 
9053	Yes my friend I said and I then shrank from hazarding the bold
9054	word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must
9055	be a philosopher 
9057	Yes he said let that be affirmed 
9058	And do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts
9059	which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they
9060	are mostly found in shreds and patches 
9062	What do you mean he said 
9063	You are aware I replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity 
9064	cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and
9065	that persons who possess them and are at the same time high spirited
9066	and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly
9067	and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their
9068	impulses and all solid principle goes out of them 
9070	Very true he said 
9071	On the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended
9072	upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are
9073	equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always
9074	in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual
9075	toil 
9077	Quite true 
9078	And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those
9079	to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share
9080	in any office or command 
9082	Certainly he said 
9083	And will they be a class which is rarely found 
9084	Yes indeed 
9085	Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers
9086	and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind
9087	of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also
9088	in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to
9089	endure the highest of all will faint under them as in any other
9090	studies and exercises 
9092	Yes he said you are quite right in testing him But what do you
9093	mean by the highest of all knowledge 
9095	You may remember I said that we divided the soul into three parts 
9096	and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage 
9097	and wisdom 
9099	Indeed he said if I had forgotten I should not deserve to hear
9100	more 
9102	And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion
9103	of them 
9105	To what do you refer 
9106	We were saying if I am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them
9107	in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way 
9108	at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a
9109	popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had
9110	preceded And you replied that such an exposition would be enough
9111	for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to
9112	be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it
9113	is for you to say 
9115	Yes he said I thought and the others thought that you gave us a
9116	fair measure of truth 
9118	But my friend I said a measure of such things Which in any degree
9119	falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect
9120	is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented
9121	and think that they need search no further 
9123	Not an uncommon case when people are indolent 
9124	Yes I said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of
9125	the State and of the laws 
9127	True 
9128	The guardian then I said must be required to take the longer circuit 
9129	and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach
9130	the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is
9131	his proper calling 
9133	What he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher
9134	than justice and the other virtues 
9136	Yes I said there is And of the virtues too we must behold not the
9137	outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished
9138	picture should satisfy us When little things are elaborated with
9139	an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full
9140	beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think
9141	the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy 
9143	A right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
9144	asking you what is this highest knowledge 
9146	Nay I said ask if you will but I am certain that you have heard
9147	the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or 
9148	as I rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have
9149	of been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that
9150	all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use
9151	of this You can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak 
9152	concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little 
9153	and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind
9154	will profit us nothing Do you think that the possession of all other
9155	things is of any value if we do not possess the good or the knowledge
9156	of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness 
9158	Assuredly not 
9159	You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good 
9160	but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge 
9162	Yes 
9163	And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean
9164	by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good 
9166	How ridiculous 
9167	Yes I said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance
9168	of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they
9169	define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them
9170	when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous 
9172	Most true he said 
9173	And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for
9174	they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as
9175	good 
9177	Certainly 
9178	And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same 
9180	True 
9181	There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this
9182	question is involved 
9184	There can be none 
9185	Further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to
9186	seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no
9187	one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what
9188	they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every
9189	one 
9191	Very true he said 
9192	Of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of
9193	all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end 
9194	and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the
9195	same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever
9196	good there is in other things of a principle such and so great
9197	as this ought the best men in our State to whom everything is entrusted 
9198	to be in the darkness of ignorance 
9200	Certainly not he said 
9201	I am sure I said that he who does not know now the beautiful and
9202	the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and
9203	I suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true
9204	knowledge of them 
9206	That he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours 
9207	And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will
9208	be perfectly ordered 
9210	Of course he replied but I wish that you would tell me whether you
9211	conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure 
9212	or different from either 
9214	Aye I said I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you
9215	would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these
9216	matters 
9218	True Socrates but I must say that one who like you has passed a
9219	lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating
9220	the opinions of others and never telling his own 
9222	Well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know 
9224	Not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no
9225	right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion 
9227	And do you not know I said that all mere opinions are bad and the
9228	best of them blind You would not deny that those who have any true
9229	notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their
9230	way along the road 
9232	Very true 
9233	And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when
9234	others will tell you of brightness and beauty 
9236	Glaucon SOCRATES 
9238	Still I must implore you Socrates said Glaucon not to turn away
9239	just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation
9240	of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and
9241	the other virtues we shall be satisfied 
9243	Yes my friend and I shall be at least equally satisfied but I cannot
9244	help fearing that I shall fall and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
9245	ridicule upon me No sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is
9246	the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts
9247	would be an effort too great for me But of the child of the good
9248	who is likest him I would fain speak if I could be sure that you
9249	wished to hear otherwise not 
9251	By all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain
9252	in our debt for the account of the parent 
9254	I do indeed wish I replied that I could pay and you receive the
9255	account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take 
9256	however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have
9257	a care that i do not render a false account although I have no intention
9258	of deceiving you 
9260	Yes we will take all the care that we can proceed 
9261	Yes I said but I must first come to an understanding with you and
9262	remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion 
9263	and at many other times 
9265	What 
9266	The old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and
9267	so of other things which we describe and define to all of them many 
9268	is applied 
9270	True he said 
9271	And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other
9272	things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for
9273	they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence
9274	of each 
9276	Very true 
9277	The many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known
9278	but not seen 
9280	Exactly 
9281	And what is the organ with which we see the visible things 
9283	The sight he said 
9284	And with the hearing I said we hear and with the other senses perceive
9285	the other objects of sense 
9287	True 
9288	But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex
9289	piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived 
9291	No I never have he said 
9292	Then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional
9293	nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to
9294	be heard 
9296	Nothing of the sort 
9297	No indeed I replied and the same is true of most if not all the
9298	other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an
9299	addition 
9301	Certainly not 
9302	But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is
9303	no seeing or being seen 
9305	How do you mean 
9306	Sight being as I conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting
9307	to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a
9308	third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes
9309	will see nothing and the colours will be invisible 
9311	Of what nature are you speaking 
9312	Of that which you term light I replied 
9313	True he said 
9314	Noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility 
9315	and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for
9316	light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing 
9318	Nay he said the reverse of ignoble 
9319	And which I said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord
9320	of this element Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly
9321	and the visible to appear 
9323	You mean the sun as you and all mankind say 
9324	May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows 
9326	How 
9327	Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun 
9329	No 
9330	Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun 
9332	By far the most like 
9333	And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which
9334	is dispensed from the sun 
9336	Exactly 
9337	Then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised
9338	by sight 
9340	True he said 
9341	And this is he whom I call the child of the good whom the good begat
9342	in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight
9343	and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world
9344	in relation to mind and the things of mind 
9346	Will you be a little more explicit he said 
9347	Why you know I said that the eyes when a person directs them towards
9348	objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon
9349	and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have
9350	no clearness of vision in them 
9352	Very true 
9353	But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines 
9354	they see clearly and there is sight in them 
9356	Certainly 
9357	And the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth
9358	and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant
9359	with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming
9360	and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about 
9361	and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have
9362	no intelligence 
9364	Just so 
9365	Now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing
9366	to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good and
9367	this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so
9368	far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too 
9369	as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this
9370	other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous
9371	instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and
9372	yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth
9373	may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has
9374	a place of honour yet higher 
9376	What a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author
9377	of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely
9378	cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good 
9380	God forbid I replied but may I ask you to consider the image in
9381	another point of view 
9383	In what point of view 
9384	You would say would you not that the sun is only the author of visibility
9385	in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth 
9386	though he himself is not generation 
9388	Certainly 
9389	In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge
9390	to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good
9391	is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power 
9393	Glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness By the light of heaven 
9394	how amazing 
9396	Yes I said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you
9397	made me utter my fancies 
9399	And pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there
9400	is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun 
9402	Yes I said there is a great deal more 
9403	Then omit nothing however slight 
9404	I will do my best I said but I should think that a great deal will
9405	have to be omitted 
9407	You have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that
9408	one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the
9409	visible I do not say heaven lest you should fancy that I am playing
9410	upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz May I suppose that you have this
9411	distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind 
9413	I have 
9414	Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide
9415	each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main
9416	divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible 
9417	and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and
9418	want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the
9419	sphere of the visible consists of images And by images I mean in
9420	the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in
9421	water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like Do you
9422	understand 
9424	Yes I understand 
9425	Imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance 
9426	to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or
9427	is made 
9429	Very good 
9430	Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different
9431	degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere
9432	of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge 
9434	Most undoubtedly 
9435	Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual
9436	is to be divided 
9438	In what manner 
9439	Thus There are two subdivisions in the lower or which the soul
9440	uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry
9441	can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle
9442	descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes
9443	out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses 
9444	making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only
9445	in and through the ideas themselves 
9447	I do not quite understand your meaning he said 
9448	Then I will try again you will understand me better when I have made
9449	some preliminary remarks You are aware that students of geometry 
9450	arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and
9451	the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several
9452	branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and everybody
9453	are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any
9454	account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with
9455	them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner 
9456	at their conclusion 
9458	Yes he said I know 
9459	And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible
9460	forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of
9461	the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw 
9462	but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the
9463	forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections
9464	in water of their own are converted by them into images but they
9465	are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only
9466	be seen with the eye of the mind 
9468	That is true 
9469	And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible although in the search
9470	after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to
9471	a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region
9472	of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below
9473	are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation
9474	to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and
9475	therefore a higher value 
9477	I understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry
9478	and the sister arts 
9480	And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible you will
9481	understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
9482	herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not
9483	as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps
9484	and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in
9485	order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the
9486	whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this 
9487	by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible
9488	object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends 
9490	I understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to
9491	be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate 
9492	I understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science
9493	of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts 
9494	as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are
9495	also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet 
9496	because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle 
9497	those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher
9498	reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them
9499	they are cognizable by the higher reason And the habit which is concerned
9500	with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term
9501	understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion
9502	and reason 
9504	You have quite conceived my meaning I said and now corresponding
9505	to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the soul reason
9506	answering to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction 
9507	to the third and perception of shadows to the last and let there
9508	be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties
9509	have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth 
9511	I understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement 
9513	 
9515	BOOK VII
9517	Socrates GLAUCON 
9519	And now I said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened
9520	or unenlightened Behold human beings living in a underground den 
9521	which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the
9522	den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs
9523	and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before
9524	them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads 
9525	Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between
9526	the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see 
9527	if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which
9528	marionette players have in front of them over which they show the
9529	puppets 
9531	I see 
9532	And do you see I said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts
9533	of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone
9534	and various materials which appear over the wall Some of them are
9535	talking others silent 
9537	You have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners 
9539	Like ourselves I replied and they see only their own shadows or
9540	the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite
9541	wall of the cave 
9543	True he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they
9544	were never allowed to move their heads 
9546	And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
9547	only see the shadows 
9549	Yes he said 
9550	And if they were able to converse with one another would they not
9551	suppose that they were naming what was actually before them 
9553	Very true 
9554	And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
9555	other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers by
9556	spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow 
9558	No question he replied 
9559	To them I said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows
9560	of the images 
9562	That is certain 
9563	And now look again and see what will naturally follow it the prisoners
9564	are released and disabused of their error At first when any of them
9565	is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck
9566	round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains 
9567	the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities
9568	of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive
9569	some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but
9570	that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned
9571	towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be
9572	his reply And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing
9573	to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will
9574	he not be perplexed Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly
9575	saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him 
9577	Far truer 
9578	And if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not
9579	have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and
9580	take in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will
9581	conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being
9582	shown to him 
9584	True he now 
9585	And suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
9586	rugged ascent and held fast until he s forced into the presence
9587	of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated When
9588	he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not
9589	be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities 
9591	Not all in a moment he said 
9592	He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world 
9593	And first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men
9594	and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then
9595	he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled
9596	heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than
9597	the sun or the light of the sun by day 
9599	Certainly 
9600	Last of he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of
9601	him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and
9602	not in another and he will contemplate him as he is 
9604	Certainly 
9605	He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season
9606	and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world 
9607	and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows
9608	have been accustomed to behold 
9610	Clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about
9611	him 
9613	And when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den
9614	and his fellow prisoners do you not suppose that he would felicitate
9615	himself on the change and pity them 
9617	Certainly he would 
9618	And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves
9619	on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
9620	which of them went before and which followed after and which were
9621	together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as
9622	to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and
9623	glories or envy the possessors of them Would he not say with Homer 
9625	Better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything 
9626	rather than think as they do and live after their manner 
9628	Yes he said I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain
9629	these false notions and live in this miserable manner 
9631	Imagine once more I said such an one coming suddenly out of the
9632	sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to
9633	have his eyes full of darkness 
9635	To be sure he said 
9636	And if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the
9637	shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while
9638	his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady and
9639	the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight
9640	might be very considerable would he not be ridiculous Men would
9641	say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and
9642	that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one
9643	tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only
9644	catch the offender and they would put him to death 
9646	No question he said 
9647	This entire allegory I said you may now append dear Glaucon to
9648	the previous argument the prison house is the world of sight the
9649	light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if
9650	you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into
9651	the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your
9652	desire I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows But 
9653	whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge
9654	the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort 
9655	and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all
9656	things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light
9657	in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth
9658	in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who
9659	would act rationally either in public or private life must have his
9660	eye fixed 
9662	I agree he said as far as I am able to understand you 
9664	Moreover I said you must not wonder that those who attain to this
9665	beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their
9666	souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to
9667	dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may
9668	be trusted 
9670	Yes very natural 
9671	And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations
9672	to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner 
9673	if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed
9674	to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of
9675	law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images
9676	of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who
9677	have never yet seen absolute justice 
9679	Anything but surprising he replied 
9680	Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments
9681	of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from
9682	coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true
9683	of the mind s eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who
9684	remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and
9685	weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that
9686	soul of man has come out of the brighter light and is unable to see
9687	because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to
9688	the day is dazzled by excess of light And he will count the one happy
9689	in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or 
9690	if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into
9691	the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which
9692	greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den 
9694	That he said is a very just distinction 
9695	But then if I am right certain professors of education must be wrong
9696	when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was
9697	not there before like sight into blind eyes 
9699	They undoubtedly say this he replied 
9700	Whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning
9701	exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to
9702	turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument
9703	of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned
9704	from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees
9705	to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being 
9706	or in other words of the good 
9708	Very true 
9709	And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the
9710	easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight 
9711	for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction 
9712	and is looking away from the truth 
9714	Yes he said such an art may be presumed 
9715	And whereas the other so called virtues of the soul seem to be akin
9716	to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate
9717	they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the of wisdom more
9718	than anything else contains a divine element which always remains 
9719	and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the
9720	other hand hurtful and useless Did you never observe the narrow
9721	intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager
9722	he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is
9723	the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the service
9724	of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness 
9726	Very true he said 
9727	But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days
9728	of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures 
9729	such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached
9730	to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision
9731	of their souls upon the things that are below if I say they had
9732	been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction 
9733	the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly
9734	as they see what their eyes are turned to now 
9736	Very likely 
9737	Yes I said and there is another thing which is likely or rather
9738	a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated
9739	and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of
9740	their education will be able ministers of State not the former 
9741	because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
9742	actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will
9743	not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already
9744	dwelling apart in the islands of the blest 
9746	Very true he replied 
9747	Then I said the business of us who are the founders of the State
9748	will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we
9749	have already shown to be the greatest of all they must continue to
9750	ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended
9751	and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now 
9753	What do you mean 
9754	I mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed 
9755	they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den 
9756	and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having
9757	or not 
9759	But is not this unjust he said ought we to give them a worse life 
9760	when they might have a better 
9762	You have again forgotten my friend I said the intention of the
9763	legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy
9764	above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole State and he
9765	held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them
9766	benefactors of the State and therefore benefactors of one another 
9767	to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his
9768	instruments in binding up the State 
9770	True he said I had forgotten 
9771	Observe Glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our
9772	philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain
9773	to them that in other States men of their class are not obliged to
9774	share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow
9775	up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have
9776	them Being self taught they cannot be expected to show any gratitude
9777	for a culture which they have never received But we have brought
9778	you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and
9779	of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly
9780	than they have been educated and you are better able to share in
9781	the double duty Wherefore each of you when his turn comes must
9782	go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing
9783	in the dark When you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand
9784	times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what
9785	the several images are and what they represent because you have
9786	seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth And thus our
9787	State which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only 
9788	and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States 
9789	in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted
9790	in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good Whereas
9791	the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant
9792	to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the State
9793	in which they are most eager the worst 
9795	Quite true he replied 
9796	And will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn
9797	at the toils of State when they are allowed to spend the greater
9798	part of their time with one another in the heavenly light 
9800	Impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which
9801	we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one
9802	of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion
9803	of our present rulers of State 
9805	Yes my friend I said and there lies the point You must contrive
9806	for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler 
9807	and then you may have a well ordered State for only in the State
9808	which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver
9809	and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of
9810	life Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs 
9811	poor and hungering after the own private advantage thinking that
9812	hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be 
9813	for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic
9814	broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves
9815	and of the whole State 
9817	Most true he replied 
9818	And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition
9819	is that of true philosophy Do you know of any other 
9821	Indeed I do not he said 
9822	And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task For if they
9823	are there will be rival lovers and they will fight 
9825	No question 
9826	Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians Surely they
9827	will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State and by whom
9828	the State is best administered and who at the same time have other
9829	honours and another and a better life than that of politics 
9831	They are the men and I will choose them he replied 
9832	And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced 
9833	and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are
9834	said to have ascended from the world below to the gods 
9836	By all means he replied 
9837	The process I said is not the turning over of an oyster shell but
9838	the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better
9839	than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below 
9840	which we affirm to be true philosophy 
9842	Quite so 
9843	And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
9844	effecting such a change 
9846	Certainly 
9847	What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming
9848	to being And another consideration has just occurred to me You will
9849	remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes 
9851	Yes that was said 
9852	Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality 
9854	What quality 
9855	Usefulness in war 
9856	Yes if possible 
9857	There were two parts in our former scheme of education were there
9858	not 
9860	Just so 
9861	There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the
9862	body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation
9863	and corruption 
9865	True 
9866	Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover No 
9868	But what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent
9869	into our former scheme 
9871	Music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic 
9872	and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making
9873	them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science 
9874	and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements
9875	of rhythm and harmony in them But in music there was nothing which
9876	tended to that good which you are now seeking 
9878	You are most accurate I said in your recollection in music there
9879	certainly was nothing of the kind But what branch of knowledge is
9880	there my dear Glaucon which is of the desired nature since all
9881	the useful arts were reckoned mean by us 
9883	Undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the
9884	arts are also excluded what remains 
9886	Well I said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and
9887	then we shall have to take something which is not special but of
9888	universal application 
9890	What may that be 
9891	A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common 
9892	and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education 
9894	What is that 
9895	The little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word 
9896	number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily
9897	partake of them 
9899	Yes 
9900	Then the art of war partakes of them 
9901	To the sure 
9902	Then Palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves Agamemnon ridiculously
9903	unfit to be a general Did you never remark how he declares that he
9904	had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the
9905	ranks of the army at Troy which implies that they had never been
9906	numbered before and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have
9907	been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant
9908	of number And if that is true what sort of general must he have
9909	been 
9911	I should say a very strange one if this was as you say 
9913	Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic 
9915	Certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of
9916	military tactics or indeed I should rather say if he is to be a
9917	man at all 
9919	I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have
9920	of this study 
9922	What is your notion 
9923	It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and
9924	which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly
9925	used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being 
9927	Will you explain your meaning he said 
9928	I will try I said and I wish you would share the enquiry with me 
9929	and say yes or no when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind
9930	what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that
9931	we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as I suspect one of
9932	them 
9934	Explain he said 
9935	I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them
9936	do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them 
9937	while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that
9938	further enquiry is imperatively demanded 
9940	You are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses
9941	are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade 
9943	No I said that is not at all my meaning 
9944	Then what is your meaning 
9945	When speaking of uninviting objects I mean those which do not pass
9946	from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which
9947	do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether
9948	at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular
9949	than of its opposite An illustration will make my meaning clearer 
9950	 here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a
9951	middle finger 
9953	Very good 
9954	You may suppose that they are seen quite close And here comes the
9955	point 
9957	What is it 
9958	Each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle
9959	or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it
9960	makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same In these cases
9961	a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger 
9962	for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than
9963	a finger 
9965	True 
9966	And therefore I said as we might expect there is nothing here which
9967	invites or excites intelligence 
9969	There is not he said 
9970	But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers 
9971	Can sight adequately perceive them and is no difference made by the
9972	circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another
9973	at the extremity And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive
9974	the qualities of thickness or thinness or softness or hardness And
9975	so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters 
9976	Is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned
9977	with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the
9978	quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same
9979	thing is felt to be both hard and soft 
9981	You are quite right he said 
9982	And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense
9983	gives of a hard which is also soft What again is the meaning of
9984	light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which
9985	is heavy light 
9987	Yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious
9988	and require to be explained 
9990	Yes I said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons
9991	to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether
9992	the several objects announced to her are one or two 
9994	True 
9995	And if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different 
9997	Certainly 
9998	And if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as
9999	in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only
10000	be conceived of as one 
10002	True 
10003	The eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused
10004	manner they were not distinguished 
10006	Yes 
10007	Whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled
10008	to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and
10009	not confused 
10011	Very true 
10012	Was not this the beginning of the enquiry What is great and What
10013	is small 
10015	Exactly so 
10016	And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible 
10018	Most true 
10019	This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the
10020	intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite
10021	impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not 
10023	I understand he said and agree with you 
10024	And to which class do unity and number belong 
10025	I do not know he replied 
10026	Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply
10027	the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the
10028	sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of
10029	the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when
10030	there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse
10031	of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins
10032	to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive
10033	at a decision asks What is absolute unity This is the way in which
10034	the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind
10035	to the contemplation of true being 
10037	And surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we
10038	see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude 
10040	Yes I said and this being true of one must be equally true of all
10041	number 
10043	Certainly 
10044	And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number 
10046	Yes 
10047	And they appear to lead the mind towards truth 
10048	Yes in a very remarkable manner 
10049	Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having
10050	a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must
10051	learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops 
10052	and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of
10053	change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician 
10055	That is true 
10056	And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher 
10057	Certainly 
10058	Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe 
10059	and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the
10060	principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs 
10061	but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers
10062	with the mind only nor again like merchants or retail traders with
10063	a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use 
10064	and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way
10065	for her to pass from becoming to truth and being 
10067	That is excellent he said 
10068	Yes I said and now having spoken of it I must add how charming
10069	the science is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end 
10070	if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper 
10072	How do you mean 
10073	I mean as I was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
10074	effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling
10075	against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument 
10076	You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any
10077	one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating 
10078	and if you divide they multiply taking care that one shall continue
10079	one and not become lost in fractions 
10081	That is very true 
10082	Now suppose a person were to say to them O my friends what are
10083	these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as
10084	you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal 
10085	invariable indivisible what would they answer 
10087	They would answer as I should conceive that they were speaking of
10088	those numbers which can only be realised in thought 
10090	Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating
10091	as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment
10092	of pure truth 
10094	Yes that is a marked characteristic of it 
10095	And have you further observed that those who have a natural talent
10096	for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge 
10097	and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although
10098	they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker
10099	than they would otherwise have been 
10101	Very true he said 
10102	And indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not
10103	many as difficult 
10105	You will not 
10106	And for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
10107	the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up 
10109	I agree 
10110	Let this then be made one of our subjects of education And next 
10111	shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us 
10113	You mean geometry 
10114	Exactly so 
10115	Clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which
10116	relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or
10117	closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre 
10118	whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference
10119	whether a general is or is not a geometrician 
10121	Yes I said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry
10122	or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the
10123	greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in
10124	any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither 
10125	as I was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her
10126	gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which
10127	she ought by all means to behold 
10129	True he said 
10130	Then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming
10131	only it does not concern us 
10133	Yes that is what we assert 
10134	Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not
10135	deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction
10136	to the ordinary language of geometricians 
10138	How so 
10139	They have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow
10140	and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and
10141	the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of
10142	daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science 
10144	Certainly he said 
10145	Then must not a further admission be made 
10146	What admission 
10147	That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal 
10148	and not of aught perishing and transient 
10150	That he replied may be readily allowed and is true 
10151	Then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth 
10152	and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now
10153	unhappily allowed to fall down 
10155	Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect 
10156	Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
10157	of your fair city should by all means learn geometry Moreover the
10158	science has indirect effects which are not small 
10160	Of what kind he said 
10161	There are the military advantages of which you spoke I said and
10162	in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who
10163	has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one
10164	who has not 
10166	Yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them 
10168	Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our
10169	youth will study 
10171	Let us do so he replied 
10172	And suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say 
10174	I am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons
10175	and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to
10176	the farmer or sailor 
10178	I am amused I said at your fear of the world which makes you guard
10179	against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and I quite
10180	admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye
10181	of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these
10182	purified and re illumined and is more precious far than ten thousand
10183	bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen Now there are two classes
10184	of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take
10185	your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly
10186	unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for
10187	they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them And
10188	therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you
10189	are proposing to argue You will very likely say with neither and
10190	that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement 
10191	at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they
10192	may receive 
10194	I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my
10195	own behalf 
10197	Then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of
10198	the sciences 
10200	What was the mistake he said 
10201	After plane geometry I said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution 
10202	instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension
10203	the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth 
10204	ought to have followed 
10206	That is true Socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about
10207	these subjects 
10209	Why yes I said and for two reasons in the first place no government
10210	patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of
10211	them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot
10212	learn them unless they have a director But then a director can hardly
10213	be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students 
10214	who are very conceited would not attend to him That however would
10215	be otherwise if the whole State became the director of these studies
10216	and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there
10217	would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made 
10218	since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of
10219	their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell
10220	the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural
10221	charm and very likely if they had the help of the State they would
10222	some day emerge into light 
10224	Yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them But I do not clearly
10225	understand the change in the order First you began with a geometry
10226	of plane surfaces 
10228	Yes I said 
10229	And you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward 
10231	Yes and I have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid
10232	geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass
10233	over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids 
10235	True he said 
10236	Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence
10237	if encouraged by the State let us go on to astronomy which will
10238	be fourth 
10240	The right order he replied And now Socrates as you rebuked the
10241	vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before my praise shall
10242	be given in your own spirit For every one as I think must see that
10243	astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this
10244	world to another 
10246	Every one but myself I said to every one else this may be clear 
10247	but not to me 
10249	And what then would you say 
10250	I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
10251	appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards 
10253	What do you mean he asked 
10254	You I replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
10255	knowledge of the things above And I dare say that if a person were
10256	to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still
10257	think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes And you
10258	are very likely right and I may be a simpleton but in my opinion 
10259	that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the
10260	soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks
10261	on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense I would
10262	deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science 
10263	his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge
10264	is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back 
10266	I acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke Still I should
10267	like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more
10268	conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking 
10270	I will tell you I said The starry heaven which we behold is wrought
10271	upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most
10272	perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far
10273	to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which
10274	are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained
10275	in them in the true number and in every true figure Now these are
10276	to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight 
10278	True he replied 
10279	The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to
10280	that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures
10281	or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus or some other
10282	great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who
10283	saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship 
10284	but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the
10285	true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion 
10287	No he replied such an idea would be ridiculous 
10288	And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks
10289	at the movements of the stars Will he not think that heaven and the
10290	things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect
10291	manner But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and
10292	day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the
10293	stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material
10294	and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that
10295	would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in
10296	investigating their exact truth 
10298	I quite agree though I never thought of this before 
10299	Then I said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems 
10300	and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the
10301	right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real
10302	use 
10304	That he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers 
10306	Yes I said and there are many other things which must also have
10307	a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of
10308	any value But can you tell me of any other suitable study 
10310	No he said not without thinking 
10311	Motion I said has many forms and not one only two of them are
10312	obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others 
10313	as I imagine which may be left to wiser persons 
10315	But where are the two 
10316	There is a second I said which is the counterpart of the one already
10317	named 
10319	And what may that be 
10320	The second I said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the
10321	first is to the eyes for I conceive that as the eyes are designed
10322	to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions 
10323	and these are sister sciences as the Pythagoreans say and we Glaucon 
10324	agree with them 
10326	Yes he replied 
10327	But this I said is a laborious study and therefore we had better
10328	go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any
10329	other applications of these sciences At the same time we must not
10330	lose sight of our own higher object 
10332	What is that 
10333	There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which
10334	our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as I was
10335	saying that they did in astronomy For in the science of harmony 
10336	as you probably know the same thing happens The teachers of harmony
10337	compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their
10338	labour like that of the astronomers is in vain 
10340	Yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking
10341	about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears
10342	close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from
10343	their neighbour s wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish
10344	an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should
10345	be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds
10346	have passed into the same either party setting their ears before
10347	their understanding 
10349	You mean I said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings
10350	and rack them on the pegs of the instrument might carry on the metaphor
10351	and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives 
10352	and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and
10353	forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore I will
10354	only say that these are not the men and that I am referring to the
10355	Pythagoreans of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony 
10356	For they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate
10357	the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain
10358	to problems that is to say they never reach the natural harmonies
10359	of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not 
10361	That he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge 
10363	A thing I replied which I would rather call useful that is if
10364	sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued
10365	in any other spirit useless Very true he said 
10367	Now when all these studies reach the point of inter communion and
10368	connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual
10369	affinities then I think but not till then will the pursuit of
10370	them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in
10371	them 
10373	I suspect so but you are speaking Socrates of a vast work 
10375	What do you mean I said the prelude or what Do you not know that
10376	all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to
10377	learn For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as
10378	a dialectician 
10380	Assuredly not he said I have hardly ever known a mathematician who
10381	was capable of reasoning 
10383	But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
10384	will have the knowledge which we require of them 
10386	Neither can this be supposed 
10387	And so Glaucon I said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic 
10388	This is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the
10389	faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight 
10390	as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the
10391	real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself And so with
10392	dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by
10393	the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and
10394	perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception
10395	of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual
10396	world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible 
10398	Exactly he said 
10399	Then this is the progress which you call dialectic 
10400	True 
10401	But the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation
10402	from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from
10403	the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly
10404	trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but
10405	are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water
10406	 which are divine and are the shadows of true existence not shadows
10407	of images cast by a light of fire which compared with the sun is
10408	only an image this power of elevating the highest principle in
10409	the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence 
10410	with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the
10411	very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in
10412	the material and visible world this power is given as I was saying 
10413	by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described 
10415	I agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe 
10416	yet from another point of view is harder still to deny This however 
10417	is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to
10418	be discussed again and again And so whether our conclusion be true
10419	or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude
10420	or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner 
10421	Say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic 
10422	and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also
10423	lead to our final rest 
10425	Dear Glaucon I said you will not be able to follow me here though
10426	I would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the
10427	absolute truth according to my notion Whether what I told you would
10428	or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say but you
10429	would have seen something like reality of that I am confident 
10431	Doubtless he replied 
10432	But I must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can
10433	reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences 
10435	Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last 
10437	And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of
10438	comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining
10439	what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are
10440	concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with
10441	a view to production and construction or for the preservation of
10442	such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences
10443	which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry
10444	and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold
10445	the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they
10446	use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them For when
10447	a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and
10448	intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what 
10449	how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become
10450	science 
10452	Impossible he said 
10453	Then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle
10454	and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to
10455	make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried
10456	in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and
10457	she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences
10458	which we have been discussing Custom terms them sciences but they
10459	ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion
10460	and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch 
10461	was called understanding But why should we dispute about names when
10462	we have realities of such importance to consider 
10464	Why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought
10465	of the mind with clearness 
10467	At any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions 
10468	two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division
10469	science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth
10470	perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and
10471	intellect with being and so to make a proportion 
10473	As being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion 
10475	And as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding
10476	to the perception of shadows But let us defer the further correlation
10477	and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it
10478	will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been 
10480	As far as I understand he said I agree 
10481	And do you also agree I said in describing the dialectician as one
10482	who attains a conception of the essence of each thing And he who
10483	does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception 
10484	in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail
10485	in intelligence Will you admit so much 
10487	Yes he said how can I deny it 
10488	And you would say the same of the conception of the good 
10490	Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea
10491	of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and
10492	is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute
10493	truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can
10494	do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good
10495	nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all 
10496	which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering
10497	in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world
10498	below and has his final quietus 
10500	In all that I should most certainly agree with you 
10501	And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State whom
10502	you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality
10503	 you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no
10504	reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters 
10506	Certainly not 
10507	Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as
10508	will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
10509	questions 
10511	Yes he said you and I together will make it 
10512	Dialectic then as you will agree is the coping stone of the sciences 
10513	and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the
10514	nature of knowledge can no further go 
10516	I agree he said 
10517	But to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are
10518	to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered 
10520	Yes clearly 
10521	You remember I said how the rulers were chosen before 
10523	Certainly he said 
10524	The same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given
10525	to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and 
10526	having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural
10527	gifts which will facilitate their education 
10529	And what are these 
10530	Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind
10531	more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity
10532	of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the mind s own and is not
10533	shared with the body 
10535	Very true he replied 
10536	Further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and
10537	be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or
10538	he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise
10539	and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which
10540	we require of him 
10542	Certainly he said he must have natural gifts 
10543	The mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no
10544	vocation and this as I was before saying is the reason why she
10545	has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand
10546	and not bastards 
10548	What do you mean 
10549	In the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry
10550	 I mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as 
10551	for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all
10552	other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour
10553	of learning or listening or enquiring Or the occupation to which
10554	he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the
10555	other sort of lameness 
10557	Certainly he said 
10558	And as to truth I said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and
10559	lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at
10560	herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary
10561	falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the
10562	mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected 
10564	To be sure 
10565	And again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every
10566	other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true
10567	son and the bastard for where there is no discernment of such qualities
10568	States and individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler 
10569	and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part
10570	of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard 
10572	That is very true he said 
10573	All these things then will have to be carefully considered by us 
10574	and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education
10575	and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have
10576	nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution
10577	and of the State but if our pupils are men of another stamp the
10578	reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule
10579	on philosophy than she has to endure at present 
10581	That would not be creditable 
10582	Certainly not I said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into
10583	earnest I am equally ridiculous 
10585	In what respect 
10586	I had forgotten I said that we were not serious and spoke with
10587	too much excitement For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled
10588	under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at
10589	the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement 
10591	Indeed I was listening and did not think so 
10592	But I who am the speaker felt that I was And now let me remind
10593	you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must
10594	not do so in this Solon was under a delusion when he said that a
10595	man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn
10596	much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary
10597	toil 
10599	Of course 
10600	And therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements
10601	of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented
10602	to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing
10603	our system of education 
10605	Why not 
10606	Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge
10607	of any kind Bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the
10608	body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no
10609	hold on the mind 
10611	Very true 
10612	Then my good friend I said do not use compulsion but let early
10613	education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to
10614	find out the natural bent 
10616	That is a very rational notion he said 
10617	Do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the
10618	battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to
10619	be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood
10620	given them 
10622	Yes I remember 
10623	The same practice may be followed I said in all these things labours 
10624	lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought
10625	to be enrolled in a select number 
10627	At what age 
10628	At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether
10629	of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless
10630	for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to
10631	learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is
10632	one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected 
10634	Certainly he replied 
10635	After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years
10636	old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they
10637	learned without any order in their early education will now be brought
10638	together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of
10639	them to one another and to true being 
10641	Yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting
10642	root 
10644	Yes I said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion
10645	of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical 
10647	I agree with you he said 
10648	These I said are the points which you must consider and those who
10649	have most of this comprehension and who are more steadfast in their
10650	learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they
10651	have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of
10652	the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have
10653	to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of
10654	them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and
10655	in company with truth to attain absolute being And here my friend 
10656	great caution is required 
10658	Why great caution 
10659	Do you not remark I said how great is the evil which dialectic has
10660	introduced 
10662	What evil he said 
10663	The students of the art are filled with lawlessness 
10664	Quite true he said 
10665	Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable
10666	in their case or will you make allowance for them 
10668	In what way make allowance 
10669	I want you I said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious
10670	son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous
10671	family and has many flatterers When he grows up to manhood he learns
10672	that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he
10673	is unable to discover Can you guess how he will be likely to behave
10674	towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during
10675	the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again
10676	when he knows Or shall I guess for you 
10678	If you please 
10679	Then I should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will
10680	be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations
10681	more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them
10682	when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be
10683	less willing to disobey them in any important matter 
10685	He will 
10686	But when he has made the discovery I should imagine that he would
10687	diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted
10688	to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase 
10689	he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them 
10690	and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble
10691	himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations 
10693	Well all that is very probable But how is the image applicable to
10694	the disciples of philosophy 
10696	In this way you know that there are certain principles about justice
10697	and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental
10698	authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them 
10700	That is true 
10701	There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter
10702	and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any
10703	sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of
10704	their fathers 
10706	True 
10707	Now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks
10708	what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught
10709	him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he
10710	is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than
10711	dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so
10712	of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will
10713	still honour and obey them as before 
10715	Impossible 
10716	And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore 
10717	and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any
10718	life other than that which flatters his desires 
10720	He cannot 
10721	And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker
10722	of it 
10724	Unquestionably 
10725	Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have
10726	described and also as I was just now saying most excusable 
10728	Yes he said and I may add pitiable 
10729	Therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens
10730	who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing
10731	them to dialectic 
10733	Certainly 
10734	There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early 
10735	for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the
10736	taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting
10737	and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like puppy dogs 
10738	they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them 
10740	Yes he said there is nothing which they like better 
10741	And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the
10742	hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing
10743	anything which they believed before and hence not only they but
10744	philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with
10745	the rest of the world 
10747	Too true he said 
10748	But when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of
10749	such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for
10750	truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement 
10751	and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead
10752	of diminishing the honour of the pursuit 
10754	Very true he said 
10755	And did we not make special provision for this when we said that
10756	the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not 
10757	as now any chance aspirant or intruder 
10759	Very true 
10760	Suppose I said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics
10761	and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice
10762	the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that
10763	be enough 
10765	Would you say six or four years he asked 
10766	Say five years I replied at the end of the time they must be sent
10767	down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other
10768	office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will
10769	get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of
10770	trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation 
10771	they will stand firm or flinch 
10773	And how long is this stage of their lives to last 
10774	Fifteen years I answered and when they have reached fifty years
10775	of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves
10776	in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come
10777	at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they
10778	must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens
10779	all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern
10780	according to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals 
10781	and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their
10782	chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics
10783	and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing
10784	some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they
10785	have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left
10786	them in their place to be governors of the State then they will depart
10787	to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there and the city will give
10788	them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the Pythian
10789	oracle consent as demi gods but if not as in any case blessed and
10790	divine 
10792	You are a sculptor Socrates and have made statues of our governors
10793	faultless in beauty 
10795	Yes I said Glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not
10796	suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to
10797	women as far as their natures can go 
10799	There you are right he said since we have made them to share in
10800	all things like the men 
10802	Well I said and you would agree would you not that what has been
10803	said about the State and the government is not a mere dream and although
10804	difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been
10805	supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born
10806	in a State one or more of them despising the honours of this present
10807	world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things
10808	right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice
10809	as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers
10810	they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set
10811	in order their own city 
10813	How will they proceed 
10814	They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants
10815	of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession
10816	of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents 
10817	these they will train in their own habits and laws I mean in the
10818	laws which we have given them and in this way the State and constitution
10819	of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness 
10820	and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most 
10822	Yes that will be the best way And I think Socrates that you have
10823	very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into
10824	being 
10826	Enough then of the perfect State and of the man who bears its image
10827	 there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him 
10829	There is no difficulty he replied and I agree with you in thinking
10830	that nothing more need be said 
10832	 
10834	BOOK VIII
10836	Socrates GLAUCON 
10838	And so Glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
10839	State wives and children are to be in common and that all education
10840	and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best
10841	philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings 
10843	That replied Glaucon has been acknowledged 
10844	Yes I said and we have further acknowledged that the governors 
10845	when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them
10846	in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and
10847	contain nothing private or individual and about their property 
10848	you remember what we agreed 
10850	Yes I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
10851	of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving
10852	from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance 
10853	and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State 
10855	True I said and now that this division of our task is concluded 
10856	let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into
10857	the old path 
10859	There is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that
10860	you had finished the description of the State you said that such
10861	a State was good and that the man was good who answered to it although 
10862	as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of State
10863	and man And you said further that if this was the true form then
10864	the others were false and of the false forms you said as I remember 
10865	that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the
10866	defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining 
10867	When we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who
10868	was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether
10869	the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable 
10870	I asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke 
10871	and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word and you began
10872	again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived 
10874	Your recollection I said is most exact 
10875	Then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in
10876	the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give
10877	me the same answer which you were about to give me then 
10879	Yes if I can I will I said 
10880	I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions
10881	of which you were speaking 
10883	That question I said is easily answered the four governments of
10884	which I spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those
10885	of Crete and Sparta which are generally applauded what is termed
10886	oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form
10887	of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally
10888	follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny 
10889	great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and
10890	worst disorder of a State I do not know do you of any other constitution
10891	which can be said to have a distinct character There are lordships
10892	and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate
10893	forms of government But these are nondescripts and may be found equally
10894	among Hellenes and among barbarians 
10896	Yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government
10897	which exist among them 
10899	Do you know I said that governments vary as the dispositions of
10900	men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of
10901	the other For we cannot suppose that States are made of oak and
10902	rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which
10903	in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them 
10905	Yes he said the States are as the men are they grow out of human
10906	characters 
10908	Then if the constitutions of States are five the dispositions of
10909	individual minds will also be five 
10911	Certainly 
10912	Him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and
10913	good we have already described 
10915	We have 
10916	Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures 
10917	being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the Spartan polity 
10918	also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical Let us place
10919	the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them
10920	we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness
10921	of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice The enquiry
10922	will then be completed And we shall know whether we ought to pursue
10923	injustice as Thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions
10924	of the argument to prefer justice 
10926	Certainly he replied we must do as you say 
10927	Shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness 
10928	of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual and
10929	begin with the government of honour I know of no name for such
10930	a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy We will compare
10931	with this the like character in the individual and after that consider
10932	oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy
10933	and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city
10934	of tyranny and once more take a look into the tyrant s soul and
10935	try to arrive at a satisfactory decision 
10937	That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable 
10939	First then I said let us enquire how timocracy the government
10940	of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best 
10941	Clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual
10942	governing power a government which is united however small cannot
10943	be moved 
10945	Very true he said 
10946	In what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the
10947	two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or
10948	with one another Shall we after the manner of Homer pray the Muses
10949	to tell us how discord first arose Shall we imagine them in solemn
10950	mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address
10951	us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest 
10953	How would they address us 
10954	After this manner A city which is thus constituted can hardly be
10955	shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also
10956	an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever 
10957	but will in time be dissolved And this is the dissolution In plants
10958	that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the earth s
10959	surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences
10960	of the circles of each are completed which in short lived existences
10961	pass over a short space and in long lived ones over a long space 
10962	But to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom
10963	and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate
10964	them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with
10965	sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the
10966	world when they ought not Now that which is of divine birth has a
10967	period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human
10968	birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution
10969	and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and
10970	four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all
10971	the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another The base of
10972	these 3 with a third added 4 when combined with five 20 and
10973	raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square
10974	which is a hundred times as great 400 4 X 100 and the other a
10975	figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting
10976	of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i 
10977	e omitting fractions the side of which is five 7 X 7 49 X 100
10978	 4900 each of them being less by one than the perfect square which
10979	includes the fractions sc 50 or less by two perfect squares of
10980	irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five 50 
10981	50 100 and a hundred cubes of three 27 X 100 2700 4900 
10982	400 8000 Now this number represents a geometrical figure which
10983	has control over the good and evil of births For when your guardians
10984	are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom
10985	out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate And though
10986	only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still
10987	they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they
10988	come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking
10989	care of us the Muses first by under valuing music which neglect
10990	will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your State
10991	will be less cultivated In the succeeding generation rulers will
10992	be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal
10993	of your different races which like Hesiod s are of gold and silver
10994	and brass and iron And so iron will be mingled with silver and brass
10995	with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality
10996	and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred
10997	and war This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord
10998	has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us 
11000	Yes and we may assume that they answer truly 
11001	Why yes I said of course they answer truly how can the Muses speak
11002	falsely 
11004	And what do the Muses say next 
11005	When discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways 
11006	the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and
11007	gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money
11008	but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue
11009	and the ancient order of things There was a battle between them 
11010	and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among
11011	individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers 
11012	whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and
11013	made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged
11014	in war and in keeping a watch against them 
11016	I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change 
11018	And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
11019	between oligarchy and aristocracy 
11021	Very true 
11022	Such will be the change and after the change has been made how will
11023	they proceed Clearly the new State being in a mean between oligarchy
11024	and the perfect State will partly follow one and partly the other 
11025	and will also have some peculiarities 
11027	True he said 
11028	In the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class
11029	from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution
11030	of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
11031	training in all these respects this State will resemble the former 
11033	True 
11034	But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are
11035	no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements 
11036	and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters 
11037	who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value
11038	set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the
11039	waging of everlasting wars this State will be for the most part
11040	peculiar 
11042	Yes 
11043	Yes I said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like
11044	those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing
11045	after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having
11046	magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment
11047	of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in
11048	which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others
11049	whom they please 
11051	That is most true he said 
11052	And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring
11053	the money which they prize they will spend that which is another
11054	man s on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures
11055	and running away like children from the law their father they have
11056	been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have
11057	neglected her who is the true Muse the companion of reason and philosophy 
11058	and have honoured gymnastic more than music 
11060	Undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is
11061	a mixture of good and evil 
11063	Why there is a mixture I said but one thing and one thing only 
11064	is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and
11065	these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element 
11067	Assuredly he said 
11068	Such is the origin and such the character of this State which has
11069	been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not
11070	required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly
11071	just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the States and
11072	all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable
11073	labour 
11075	Very true he replied 
11076	Now what man answers to this form of government how did he come into
11077	being and what is he like 
11079	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
11081	I think said Adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises
11082	him he is not unlike our friend Glaucon 
11084	Perhaps I said he may be like him in that one point but there are
11085	other respects in which he is very different 
11087	In what respects 
11088	He should have more of self assertion and be less cultivated and
11089	yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no
11090	speaker Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the
11091	educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous
11092	to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of
11093	power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he
11094	is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier
11095	and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises
11096	and of the chase 
11098	Yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy 
11100	Such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets
11101	older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a
11102	piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards
11103	virtue having lost his best guardian 
11105	Who was that said Adeimantus 
11106	Philosophy I said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode
11107	in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life 
11109	Good he said 
11110	Such I said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical
11111	State 
11113	Exactly 
11114	His origin is as follows He is often the young son of a grave father 
11115	who dwells in an ill governed city of which he declines the honours
11116	and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way 
11117	but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble 
11119	And how does the son come into being 
11120	The character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother
11121	complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which
11122	the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women Further 
11123	when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead
11124	of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever
11125	happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always
11126	centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference 
11127	she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a
11128	man and far too easy going adding all the other complaints about
11129	her own ill treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing 
11131	Yes said Adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints
11132	are so like themselves 
11134	And you know I said that the old servants also who are supposed
11135	to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in
11136	the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money
11137	to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute
11138	them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate
11139	upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father He
11140	has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing 
11141	those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons 
11142	and held in no esteem while the busy bodies are honoured and applauded 
11143	The result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing
11144	 hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of
11145	his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn
11146	opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational
11147	principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and
11148	appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having
11149	kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a
11150	middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the
11151	middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant
11152	and ambitious 
11154	You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly 
11155	Then we have now I said the second form of government and the second
11156	type of character 
11158	We have 
11159	Next let us look at another man who as Aeschylus says 
11161	Is set over against another State or rather as our plan requires 
11162	begin with the State 
11164	By all means 
11165	I believe that oligarchy follows next in order 
11166	And what manner of government do you term oligarchy 
11167	A government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich
11168	have power and the poor man is deprived of it 
11170	I understand he replied 
11171	Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to
11172	oligarchy arises 
11174	Yes 
11175	Well I said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes
11176	into the other 
11178	How 
11179	The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is
11180	ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for
11181	what do they or their wives care about the law 
11183	Yes indeed 
11184	And then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus
11185	the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money 
11187	Likely enough 
11188	And so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making
11189	a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue
11190	are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises
11191	as the other falls 
11193	True 
11194	And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State 
11195	virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured 
11197	Clearly 
11198	And what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is
11199	neglected 
11201	That is obvious 
11202	And so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become
11203	lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man 
11204	and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 
11206	They do so 
11207	They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the
11208	qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower
11209	in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow
11210	no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share
11211	in the government These changes in the constitution they effect by
11212	force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work 
11214	Very true 
11215	And this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established 
11217	Yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government 
11218	and what are the defects of which we were speaking 
11220	First of all I said consider the nature of the qualification just
11221	think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their
11222	property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though
11223	he were a better pilot 
11225	You mean that they would shipwreck 
11226	Yes and is not this true of the government of anything 
11228	I should imagine so 
11229	Except a city or would you include a city 
11230	Nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch
11231	as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all 
11233	This then will be the first great defect of oligarchy 
11235	Clearly 
11236	And here is another defect which is quite as bad 
11237	What defect 
11238	The inevitable division such a State is not one but two States 
11239	the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the
11240	same spot and always conspiring against one another 
11242	That surely is at least as bad 
11243	Another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are
11244	incapable of carrying on any war Either they arm the multitude and
11245	then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do
11246	not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed 
11247	few to fight as they are few to rule And at the same time their fondness
11248	for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes 
11250	How discreditable 
11251	And as we said before under such a constitution the same persons
11252	have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors 
11253	all in one Does that look well 
11255	Anything but well 
11256	There is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and
11257	to which this State first begins to be liable 
11259	What evil 
11260	A man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property 
11261	yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer
11262	a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite 
11263	but only a poor helpless creature 
11265	Yes that is an evil which also first begins in this State 
11267	The evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both
11268	the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty 
11270	True 
11271	But think again In his wealthy days while he was spending his money 
11272	was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes
11273	of citizenship Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body 
11274	although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift 
11276	As you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift 
11278	May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the
11279	drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city
11280	as the other is of the hive 
11282	Just so Socrates 
11283	And God has made the flying drones Adeimantus all without stings 
11284	whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but
11285	others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who
11286	in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal
11287	class as they are termed 
11289	Most true he said 
11290	Clearly then whenever you see paupers in a State somewhere in that
11291	neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers
11292	of temples and all sorts of malefactors 
11294	Clearly 
11295	Well I said and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers 
11297	Yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler 
11299	And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals
11300	to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities
11301	are careful to restrain by force 
11303	Certainly we may be so bold 
11304	The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education 
11305	ill training and an evil constitution of the State 
11307	True 
11308	Such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there
11309	may be many other evils 
11311	Very likely 
11312	Then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are
11313	elected for their wealth may now be dismissed Let us next proceed
11314	to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to
11315	this State 
11317	By all means 
11318	Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this
11319	wise 
11321	How 
11322	A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at
11323	first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps 
11324	but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State
11325	as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may
11326	have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial
11327	under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or
11328	exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property
11329	taken from him 
11331	Nothing more likely 
11332	And the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and
11333	his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion head foremost
11334	from his bosom s throne humbled by poverty he takes to money making
11335	and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together 
11336	Is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element
11337	on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within
11338	him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar 
11340	Most true he replied 
11341	And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
11342	on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place 
11343	he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned
11344	into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire
11345	anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so
11346	much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it 
11348	Of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the
11349	conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one 
11351	And the avaricious I said is the oligarchical youth 
11352	Yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like
11353	the State out of which oligarchy came 
11355	Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them 
11357	Very good 
11358	First then they resemble one another in the value which they set
11359	upon wealth 
11361	Certainly 
11362	Also in their penurious laborious character the individual only
11363	satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to
11364	them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable 
11366	True 
11367	He is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes
11368	a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud 
11369	Is he not a true image of the State which he represents 
11371	He appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him
11372	as well as by the State 
11374	You see that he is not a man of cultivation I said 
11375	I imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made
11376	a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 
11378	Excellent I said Yet consider Must we not further admit that owing
11379	to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires
11380	as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general
11381	habit of life 
11383	True 
11384	Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
11385	rogueries 
11387	Where must I look 
11388	You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly 
11389	as in the guardianship of an orphan 
11391	Aye 
11392	It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
11393	him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced
11394	virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by
11395	reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he
11396	trembles for his possessions 
11398	To be sure 
11399	Yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires
11400	of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to
11401	spend what is not his own 
11403	Yes and they will be strong in him too 
11404	The man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and
11405	not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail
11406	over his inferior ones 
11408	True 
11409	For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people 
11410	yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far
11411	away and never come near him 
11413	I should expect so 
11414	And surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in
11415	a State for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition 
11416	he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is
11417	he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help
11418	and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with
11419	a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that
11420	he loses the prize and saves his money 
11422	Very true 
11423	Can we any longer doubt then that the miser and money maker answers
11424	to the oligarchical State 
11426	There can be no doubt 
11427	Next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to
11428	be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the
11429	democratic man and bring him up for judgement 
11431	That he said is our method 
11432	Well I said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy
11433	arise Is it not on this wise The good at which such a State alms
11434	is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable 
11436	What then 
11437	The rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth 
11438	refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth
11439	because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and
11440	buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance 
11442	To be sure 
11443	There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation
11444	cannot exist together in citizens of the same State to any considerable
11445	extent one or the other will be disregarded 
11447	That is tolerably clear 
11448	And in oligarchical States from the general spread of carelessness
11449	and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary 
11451	Yes often 
11452	And still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting
11453	and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their
11454	citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate
11455	and conspire against those who have got their property and against
11456	everybody else and are eager for revolution 
11458	That is true 
11459	On the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and
11460	pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert
11461	their sting that is their money into some one else who is not
11462	on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over
11463	multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper
11464	to abound in the State 
11466	Yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain 
11468	The evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either
11469	by restricting a man s use of his own property or by another remedy 
11471	What other 
11472	One which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the
11473	citizens to look to their characters Let there be a general rule
11474	that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk 
11475	and there will be less of this scandalous money making and the evils
11476	of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State 
11478	Yes they will be greatly lessened 
11479	At present the governors induced by the motives which I have named 
11480	treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially
11481	the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life
11482	of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and
11483	are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain 
11485	Very true 
11486	They themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent
11487	as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue 
11489	Yes quite as indifferent 
11490	Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them And often
11491	rulers and their subjects may come in one another s way whether on
11492	a pilgrimage or a march as fellow soldiers or fellow sailors aye 
11493	and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment
11494	of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will
11495	be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man
11496	may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never
11497	spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he
11498	sees such an one puffing and at his wit s end how can he avoid drawing
11499	the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has
11500	the courage to despoil them And when they meet in private will not
11501	people be saying to one another Our warriors are not good for much 
11503	Yes he said I am quite aware that this is their way of talking 
11505	And as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without
11506	may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external
11507	provocation a commotion may arise within in the same way wherever
11508	there is weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness 
11509	of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing
11510	from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies 
11511	and then the State falls sick and is at war with herself and may
11512	be at times distracted even when there is no external cause 
11514	Yes surely 
11515	And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered
11516	their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the
11517	remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this
11518	is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected
11519	by lot 
11521	Yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution
11522	has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite
11523	party to withdraw 
11525	And now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government
11526	have they for as the government is such will be the man 
11528	Clearly he said 
11529	In the first place are they not free and is not the city full of
11530	freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes 
11532	 Tis said so he replied 
11533	And where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for
11534	himself his own life as he pleases 
11536	Clearly 
11537	Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human
11538	natures 
11540	There will 
11541	This then seems likely to be the fairest of States being an embroidered
11542	robe which is spangled with every sort of flower And just as women
11543	and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming 
11544	so there are many men to whom this State which is spangled with the
11545	manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of
11546	States 
11548	Yes 
11549	Yes my good Sir and there will be no better in which to look for
11550	a government 
11552	Why 
11553	Because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment
11554	of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a State as we
11555	have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at
11556	which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when
11557	he has made his choice he may found his State 
11559	He will be sure to have patterns enough 
11560	And there being no necessity I said for you to govern in this State 
11561	even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like 
11562	or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others
11563	are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity
11564	also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast 
11565	that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy
11566	 is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful
11568	For the moment yes 
11569	And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming 
11570	Have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although
11571	they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are
11572	and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and
11573	nobody sees or cares 
11575	Yes he replied many and many a one 
11576	See too I said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the don t
11577	care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the
11578	fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the
11579	city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted
11580	nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood
11581	been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and
11582	a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours
11583	under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make
11584	a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the
11585	people s friend 
11587	Yes she is of a noble spirit 
11588	These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which
11589	is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and
11590	dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike 
11592	We know her well 
11593	Consider now I said what manner of man the individual is or rather
11594	consider as in the case of the State how he comes into being 
11596	Very good he said 
11597	Is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
11598	father who has trained him in his own habits 
11600	Exactly 
11601	And like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which
11602	are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which
11603	are called unnecessary 
11605	Obviously 
11606	Would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are
11607	the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures 
11609	I should 
11610	Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and
11611	of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us And they are rightly
11612	so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial
11613	and what is necessary and cannot help it 
11615	True 
11616	We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary 
11617	We are not 
11618	And the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from
11619	his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good 
11620	and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying
11621	that all these are unnecessary 
11623	Yes certainly 
11624	Suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may
11625	have a general notion of them 
11627	Very good 
11628	Will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments 
11629	in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the
11630	necessary class 
11632	That is what I should suppose 
11633	The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and
11634	it is essential to the continuance of life 
11636	Yes 
11637	But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for
11638	health 
11640	Certainly 
11641	And the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other
11642	luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained
11643	in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the
11644	pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary 
11646	Very true 
11647	May we not say that these desires spend and that the others make
11648	money because they conduce to production 
11650	Certainly 
11651	And of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds
11652	good 
11654	True 
11655	And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures
11656	and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires 
11657	whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical 
11659	Very true 
11660	Again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical 
11661	the following as I suspect is commonly the process 
11663	What is the process 
11664	When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing 
11665	in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come
11666	to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide
11667	for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then 
11668	as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle
11669	within him into the democratical 
11671	Inevitably 
11672	And as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected
11673	by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens 
11674	so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from
11675	without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike
11676	again helping that which is akin and alike 
11678	Certainly 
11679	And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within
11680	him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or
11681	rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite
11682	faction and he goes to war with himself 
11684	It must be so 
11685	And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the
11686	oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished 
11687	a spirit of reverence enters into the young man s soul and order is
11688	restored 
11690	Yes he said that sometimes happens 
11691	And then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh
11692	ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father 
11693	does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous 
11695	Yes he said that is apt to be the way 
11696	They draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse
11697	with them breed and multiply in him 
11699	Very true 
11700	At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man s soul which
11701	they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits
11702	and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are
11703	dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels 
11705	None better 
11706	False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
11707	place 
11709	They are certain to do so 
11710	And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus eaters 
11711	and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any
11712	help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid
11713	vain conceits shut the gate of the king s fastness and they will
11714	neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers
11715	offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or
11716	receive them There is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty 
11717	which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them 
11718	and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the
11719	mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly
11720	expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble
11721	of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border 
11723	Yes with a will 
11724	And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is
11725	now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries 
11726	the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy
11727	and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads 
11728	and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them
11729	by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty 
11730	and waste magnificence and impudence courage And so the young man
11731	passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school
11732	of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary
11733	pleasures 
11735	Yes he said the change in him is visible enough 
11736	After this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on
11737	unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he
11738	be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years
11739	have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he
11740	then re admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues and
11741	does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case
11742	he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting
11743	the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first
11744	and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the
11745	hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all
11746	equally 
11748	Very true he said 
11749	Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word
11750	of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions
11751	of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he
11752	ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever
11753	this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are
11754	all alike and that one is as good as another 
11756	Yes he said that is the way with him 
11757	Yes I said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the
11758	hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute 
11759	then he becomes a water drinker and tries to get thin then he takes
11760	a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything 
11761	then once more living the life of a philosopher often he is busy
11762	with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes
11763	into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior 
11764	off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that 
11765	His life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence
11766	he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on 
11768	Yes he replied he is all liberty and equality 
11769	Yes I said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the
11770	lives of many he answers to the State which we described as fair
11771	and spangled And many a man and many a woman will take him for their
11772	pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is
11773	contained in him 
11775	Just so 
11776	Let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called
11777	the democratic man 
11779	Let that be his place he said 
11780	Last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and State alike 
11781	tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider 
11783	Quite true he said 
11784	Say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it
11785	has a democratic origin is evident 
11787	Clearly 
11788	And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy
11789	from oligarchy I mean after a sort 
11791	How 
11792	The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which
11793	it was maintained was excess of wealth am I not right 
11795	Yes 
11796	And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things
11797	for the sake of money getting was also the ruin of oligarchy 
11799	True 
11800	And democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings
11801	her to dissolution 
11803	What good 
11804	Freedom I replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the
11805	glory of the State and that therefore in a democracy alone will
11806	the freeman of nature deign to dwell 
11808	Yes the saying is in everybody s mouth 
11809	I was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the
11810	neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which
11811	occasions a demand for tyranny 
11813	How so 
11814	When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers
11815	presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine
11816	of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful
11817	draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that
11818	they are cursed oligarchs 
11820	Yes he replied a very common occurrence 
11821	Yes I said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves
11822	who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who
11823	are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after
11824	her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public 
11825	Now in such a State can liberty have any limit 
11827	Certainly not 
11828	By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by
11829	getting among the animals and infecting them 
11831	How do you mean 
11832	I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of
11833	his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father 
11834	he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this
11835	is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen
11836	with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either 
11838	Yes he said that is the way 
11839	And these are not the only evils I said there are several lesser
11840	ones In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his
11841	scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young
11842	and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old 
11843	and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend
11844	to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth
11845	to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the
11846	manners of the young 
11848	Quite true he said 
11849	The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with
11850	money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser 
11851	nor must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes
11852	in relation to each other 
11854	Why not as Aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips 
11856	That is what I am doing I replied and I must add that no one who
11857	does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which
11858	the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy
11859	than in any other State for truly the she dogs as the proverb says 
11860	are as good as their she mistresses and the horses and asses have
11861	a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen 
11862	and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not
11863	leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst
11864	with liberty 
11866	When I take a country walk he said I often experience what you describe 
11867	You and I have dreamed the same thing 
11869	And above all I said and as the result of all see how sensitive
11870	the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of
11871	authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for
11872	the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them 
11874	Yes he said I know it too well 
11875	Such my friend I said is the fair and glorious beginning out of
11876	which springs tyranny 
11878	Glorious indeed he said But what is the next step 
11879	The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified
11880	and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being
11881	that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in
11882	the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons
11883	and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government 
11885	True 
11886	The excess of liberty whether in States or individuals seems only
11887	to pass into excess of slavery 
11889	Yes the natural order 
11890	And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated
11891	form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty 
11893	As we might expect 
11894	That however was not as I believe your question you rather desired
11895	to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy
11896	and democracy and is the ruin of both 
11898	Just so he replied 
11899	Well I said I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts 
11900	of whom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the
11901	followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless 
11902	and others having stings 
11904	A very just comparison 
11905	These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are
11906	generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body And the good
11907	physician and lawgiver of the State ought like the wise bee master 
11908	to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming
11909	in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them
11910	and their cells cut out as speedily as possible 
11912	Yes by all means he said 
11913	Then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine
11914	democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for
11915	in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic
11916	than there were in the oligarchical State 
11918	That is true 
11919	And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified 
11921	How so 
11922	Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven
11923	from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas
11924	in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while
11925	the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema
11926	and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies
11927	almost everything is managed by the drones 
11929	Very true he said 
11930	Then there is another class which is always being severed from the
11931	mass 
11933	What is that 
11934	They are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be
11935	the richest 
11937	Naturally so 
11938	They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount
11939	of honey to the drones 
11941	Why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have
11942	little 
11944	And this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them 
11946	That is pretty much the case he said 
11947	The people are a third class consisting of those who work with their
11948	own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon 
11949	This when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a
11950	democracy 
11952	True he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate
11953	unless they get a little honey 
11955	And do they not share I said Do not their leaders deprive the rich
11956	of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same
11957	time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves 
11959	Why yes he said to that extent the people do share 
11960	And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to
11961	defend themselves before the people as they best can 
11963	What else can they do 
11964	And then although they may have no desire of change the others charge
11965	them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy 
11966	True 
11968	And the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord 
11969	but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers 
11970	seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs
11971	in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments
11972	them and breeds revolution in them 
11974	That is exactly the truth 
11975	Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another 
11977	True 
11978	The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
11979	into greatness 
11981	Yes that is their way 
11982	This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he
11983	first appears above ground he is a protector 
11985	Yes that is quite clear 
11986	How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant Clearly when
11987	he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple
11988	of Lycaean Zeus 
11990	What tale 
11991	The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human
11992	victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to
11993	become a wolf Did you never hear it 
11995	Oh yes 
11996	And the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely
11997	at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen 
11998	by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court
11999	and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy
12000	tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills
12001	and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition
12002	of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his
12003	destiny Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or
12004	from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant 
12006	Inevitably 
12007	This I said is he who begins to make a party against the rich 
12009	The same 
12010	After a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies 
12011	a tyrant full grown 
12013	That is clear 
12014	And if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death
12015	by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him 
12017	Yes he said that is their usual way 
12018	Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device
12019	of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career Let
12020	not the people s friend as they say be lost to them 
12022	Exactly 
12023	The people readily assent all their fears are for him they have
12024	none for themselves 
12026	Very true 
12027	And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy
12028	of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to Croesus 
12030	By pebbly Hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed
12031	to be a coward 
12033	And quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed
12034	again 
12036	But if he is caught he dies 
12037	Of course 
12038	And he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding
12039	the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing
12040	up in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand no longer protector 
12041	but tyrant absolute 
12043	No doubt he said 
12044	And now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the
12045	State in which a creature like him is generated 
12047	Yes he said let us consider that 
12048	At first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and
12049	he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who
12050	is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors 
12051	and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting
12052	to be so kind and good to every one 
12054	Of course he said 
12055	But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty 
12056	and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring
12057	up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader 
12059	To be sure 
12060	Has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished
12061	by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their
12062	daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him Clearly 
12064	And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom 
12065	and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for
12066	destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for
12067	all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war 
12069	He must 
12070	Now he begins to grow unpopular 
12071	A necessary result 
12072	Then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power 
12073	speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous
12074	of them cast in his teeth what is being done 
12076	Yes that may be expected 
12077	And the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot
12078	stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything 
12080	He cannot 
12081	And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is
12082	high minded who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy
12083	of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or
12084	no until he has made a purgation of the State 
12086	Yes he said and a rare purgation 
12087	Yes I said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of
12088	the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part 
12089	but he does the reverse 
12091	If he is to rule I suppose that he cannot help himself 
12093	What a blessed alternative I said to be compelled to dwell only
12094	with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all 
12096	Yes that is the alternative 
12097	And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites
12098	and the greater devotion in them will he require 
12100	Certainly 
12101	And who are the devoted band and where will he procure them 
12103	They will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays
12104	them 
12106	By the dog I said here are more drones of every sort and from every
12107	land 
12109	Yes he said there are 
12110	But will he not desire to get them on the spot 
12111	How do you mean 
12112	He will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free
12113	and enrol them in his bodyguard 
12115	To be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all 
12117	What a blessed creature I said must this tyrant be he has put to
12118	death the others and has these for his trusted friends 
12120	Yes he said they are quite of his sort 
12121	Yes I said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into
12122	existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate
12123	and avoid him 
12125	Of course 
12126	Verily then tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian 
12128	Why so 
12129	Why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 
12131	Tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to
12132	say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions 
12134	Yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other
12135	things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets 
12137	And therefore I said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive
12138	us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them
12139	into our State because they are the eulogists of tyranny 
12141	Yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us 
12143	But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and
12144	hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over
12145	to tyrannies and democracies 
12147	Very true 
12148	Moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest
12149	honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest
12150	from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill 
12151	the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of
12152	breath to proceed further 
12154	True 
12155	But we are wandering from the subject Let us therefore return and
12156	enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various
12157	and ever changing army of his 
12159	If he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate
12160	and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons
12161	may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would
12162	otherwise have to impose upon the people 
12164	And when these fail 
12165	Why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male
12166	or female will be maintained out of his father s estate 
12168	You mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being 
12169	will maintain him and his companions 
12171	Yes he said they cannot help themselves 
12172	But what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a grown up
12173	son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should
12174	be supported by the son The father did not bring him into being 
12175	or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he
12176	should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support
12177	him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should
12178	protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the
12179	government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed And so
12180	he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might
12181	drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates 
12183	By heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he
12184	has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out 
12185	he will find that he is weak and his son strong 
12187	Why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence What 
12188	beat his father if he opposes him 
12190	Yes he will having first disarmed him 
12191	Then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and
12192	this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake 
12193	as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the
12194	slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny
12195	of slaves Thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes
12196	into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery 
12198	True he said 
12199	Very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed
12200	the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy
12201	to tyranny 
12203	Yes quite enough he said 
12205	 
12207	BOOK IX
12209	Socrates ADEIMANTUS 
12211	Last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more
12212	to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he
12213	live in happiness or in misery 
12215	Yes he said he is the only one remaining 
12216	There is however I said a previous question which remains unanswered 
12218	What question 
12219	I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number
12220	of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will
12221	always be confused 
12223	Well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
12225	Very true I said and observe the point which I want to understand 
12226	Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be
12227	unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they
12228	are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail
12229	over them either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak 
12230	while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more
12231	of them 
12233	Which appetites do you mean 
12234	I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling
12235	power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or
12236	drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy
12237	his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting
12238	incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of
12239	forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company
12240	with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
12242	Most true he said 
12243	But when a man s pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going
12244	to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble
12245	thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having
12246	first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but
12247	just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments
12248	and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves
12249	in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire
12250	to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future 
12251	when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel
12252	against any one I say when after pacifying the two irrational
12253	principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes
12254	his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is
12255	least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
12257	I quite agree 
12258	In saying this I have been running into a digression but the point
12259	which I desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there
12260	is a lawless wild beast nature which peers out in sleep Pray consider
12261	whether I am right and you agree with me 
12263	Yes I agree 
12264	And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic
12265	man He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under
12266	a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but
12267	discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
12269	True 
12270	And then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort
12271	of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
12272	extreme from an abhorrence of his father s meanness At last being
12273	a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions
12274	until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion 
12275	but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures After
12276	this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
12278	Yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
12280	And now I said years will have passed away and you must conceive
12281	this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his father s
12282	principles 
12284	I can imagine him 
12285	Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son
12286	which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly
12287	lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and
12288	his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the
12289	opposite party assist the opposite ones As soon as these dire magicians
12290	and tyrant makers find that they are losing their hold on him they
12291	contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle
12292	and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is
12293	the only image which will adequately describe him 
12295	Yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
12296	And when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
12297	garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now
12298	let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting
12299	of desire which they implant in his drone like nature then at last
12300	this lord of the soul having Madness for the captain of his guard 
12301	breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions
12302	or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense
12303	of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and
12304	casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in
12305	madness to the full 
12307	Yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
12309	And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
12311	I should not wonder 
12312	Further I said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
12314	He has 
12315	And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind 
12316	will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over
12317	the gods 
12319	That he will 
12320	And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
12321	when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he
12322	becomes drunken lustful passionate O my friend is not that so 
12324	Assuredly 
12325	Such is the man and such is his origin And next how does he live 
12327	Suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
12329	I imagine I said at the next step in his progress that there will
12330	be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that
12331	sort of thing Love is the lord of the house within him and orders
12332	all the concerns of his soul 
12334	That is certain 
12335	Yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable 
12336	and their demands are many 
12338	They are indeed he said 
12339	His revenues if he has any are soon spent 
12340	True 
12341	Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
12342	Of course 
12343	When he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest
12344	like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by
12345	them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain
12346	of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud
12347	or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
12349	Yes that is sure to be the case 
12350	He must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains
12351	and pangs 
12353	He must 
12354	And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new
12355	got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being
12356	younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and
12357	if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice
12358	of theirs 
12360	No doubt he will 
12361	And if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all
12362	to cheat and deceive them 
12364	Very true 
12365	And if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
12367	Yes probably 
12368	And if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend 
12369	Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
12371	Nay he said I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
12373	But O heavens Adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of
12374	a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe
12375	that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary
12376	to his very existence and would place her under the authority of
12377	the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that 
12378	under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old
12379	father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some
12380	newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
12382	Yes indeed he said I believe that he would 
12383	Truly then I said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father
12384	and mother 
12386	He is indeed he replied 
12387	He first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures
12388	are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into
12389	a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he
12390	proceeds to clear a temple Meanwhile the old opinions which he had
12391	when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown
12392	by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the
12393	bodyguard of love and share his empire These in his democratic days 
12394	when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only
12395	let loose in the dreams of sleep But now that he is under the dominion
12396	of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then
12397	very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder 
12398	or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act Love
12399	is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself
12400	a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a State to the performance
12401	of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble
12402	of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought
12403	in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose
12404	within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself Have we
12405	not here a picture of his way of life 
12407	Yes indeed he said 
12408	And if there are only a few of them in the State the rest of the
12409	people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or
12410	mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them
12411	for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little
12412	pieces of mischief in the city 
12414	What sort of mischief 
12415	For example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads 
12416	robbers of temples man stealers of the community or if they are
12417	able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take
12418	bribes 
12420	A small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few
12421	in number 
12423	Yes I said but small and great are comparative terms and all these
12424	things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State do
12425	not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious
12426	class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their
12427	strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from
12428	among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul 
12429	and him they create their tyrant 
12431	Yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
12433	If the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he
12434	began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the
12435	power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland 
12436	as the Cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has
12437	introduced to be their rulers and masters This is the end of his
12438	passions and desires 
12440	Exactly 
12441	When such men are only private individuals and before they get power 
12442	this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers
12443	or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their
12444	turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every
12445	sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point
12446	they know them no more 
12448	Yes truly 
12449	They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends
12450	of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
12452	Certainly not 
12453	And may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
12454	No question 
12455	Also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
12457	Yes he said and we were perfectly right 
12458	Let us then sum up in a word I said the character of the worst man 
12459	he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
12461	Most true 
12462	And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and
12463	the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
12465	Socrates GLAUCON 
12467	That is certain said Glaucon taking his turn to answer 
12469	And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the
12470	most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually
12471	and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in
12472	general 
12474	Yes he said inevitably 
12475	And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State and
12476	the democratical man like the democratical State and the same of
12477	the others 
12479	Certainly 
12480	And as State is to State in virtue and happiness so is man in relation
12481	to man 
12483	To be sure 
12484	Then comparing our original city which was under a king and the
12485	city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
12487	They are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best
12488	and the other is the very worst 
12490	There can be no mistake I said as to which is which and therefore
12491	I will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
12492	about their relative happiness and misery And here we must not allow
12493	ourselves to be panic stricken at the apparition of the tyrant who
12494	is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but
12495	let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about 
12496	and then we will give our opinion 
12498	A fair invitation he replied and I see as every one must that
12499	a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a
12500	king the happiest 
12502	And in estimating the men too may I not fairly make a like request 
12503	that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through
12504	human nature He must not be like a child who looks at the outside
12505	and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes
12506	to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight May I
12507	suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one
12508	who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and
12509	been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations 
12510	where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in
12511	the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and
12512	misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
12514	That again he said is a very fair proposal 
12515	Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and
12516	have before now met with such a person We shall then have some one
12517	who will answer our enquiries 
12519	By all means 
12520	Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the
12521	State bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the
12522	other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
12524	What do you mean he asked 
12525	Beginning with the State I replied would you say that a city which
12526	is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
12528	No city he said can be more completely enslaved 
12529	And yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such
12530	a State 
12532	Yes he said I see that there are a few but the people speaking
12533	generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
12535	Then if the man is like the State I said must not the same rule
12536	prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements
12537	in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also
12538	the worst and maddest 
12540	Inevitably 
12541	And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman 
12542	or of a slave 
12544	He has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
12545	And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable
12546	of acting voluntarily 
12548	Utterly incapable 
12549	And also the soul which is under a tyrant I am speaking of the soul
12550	taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there
12551	is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
12553	Certainly 
12554	And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
12555	Poor 
12556	And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
12558	True 
12559	And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear 
12561	Yes indeed 
12562	Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and
12563	sorrow and groaning and pain 
12565	Certainly not 
12566	And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery
12567	than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
12569	Impossible 
12570	Reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical State
12571	to be the most miserable of States 
12573	And I was right he said 
12574	Certainly I said And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical
12575	man what do you say of him 
12577	I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
12578	There I said I think that you are beginning to go wrong 
12580	What do you mean 
12581	I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
12583	Then who is more miserable 
12584	One of whom I am about to speak 
12585	Who is that 
12586	He who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private
12587	life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public
12588	tyrant 
12590	From what has been said I gather that you are right 
12591	Yes I replied but in this high argument you should be a little more
12592	certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this
12593	respecting good and evil is the greatest 
12595	Very true he said 
12596	Let me then offer you an illustration which may I think throw a
12597	light upon this subject 
12599	What is your illustration 
12600	The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from
12601	them you may form an idea of the tyrant s condition for they both
12602	have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
12604	Yes that is the difference 
12605	You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from
12606	their servants 
12608	What should they fear 
12609	Nothing But do you observe the reason of this 
12610	Yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the
12611	protection of each individual 
12613	Very true I said But imagine one of these owners the master say
12614	of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves 
12615	carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen
12616	to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife
12617	and children should be put to death by his slaves 
12619	Yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
12620	The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of
12621	his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things 
12622	much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
12624	Yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
12626	And suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with
12627	neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another 
12628	and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
12630	His case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere
12631	surrounded and watched by enemies 
12633	And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound
12634	 he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all
12635	sorts of fears and lusts His soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone 
12636	of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or
12637	to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives
12638	in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any
12639	other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
12641	Very true he said 
12642	And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill governed in his
12643	own person the tyrannical man I mean whom you just now decided
12644	to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable
12645	when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune
12646	to be a public tyrant He has to be master of others when he is not
12647	master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled
12648	to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with
12649	other men 
12651	Yes he said the similitude is most exact 
12652	Is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant
12653	lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
12655	Certainly 
12656	He who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave 
12657	and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and
12658	to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind He has desires which
12659	he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one 
12660	and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him 
12661	all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions 
12662	and distractions even as the State which he resembles and surely
12663	the resemblance holds 
12665	Very true he said 
12666	Moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power 
12667	he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more
12668	unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is
12669	the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence
12670	is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else
12671	as miserable as himself 
12673	No man of any sense will dispute your words 
12674	Come then I said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests
12675	proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first
12676	in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others
12677	follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical 
12678	oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
12680	The decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses
12681	coming on the stage and I must judge them in the order in which they
12682	enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
12684	Need we hire a herald or shall I announce that the son of Ariston
12685	 the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest 
12686	and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself 
12687	and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable 
12688	and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also
12689	the greatest tyrant of his State 
12691	Make the proclamation yourself he said 
12692	And shall I add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
12694	Let the words be added 
12695	Then this I said will be our first proof and there is another 
12696	which may also have some weight 
12698	What is that 
12699	The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that
12700	the individual soul like the State has been divided by us into three
12701	principles the division may I think furnish a new demonstration 
12703	Of what nature 
12704	It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond 
12705	also three desires and governing powers 
12707	How do you mean he said 
12708	There is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns 
12709	another with which he is angry the third having many forms has
12710	no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from
12711	the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating
12712	and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements
12713	of it also money loving because such desires are generally satisfied
12714	by the help of money 
12716	That is true he said 
12717	If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part
12718	were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a
12719	single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part
12720	of the soul as loving gain or money 
12722	I agree with you 
12723	Again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
12724	and getting fame 
12726	True 
12727	Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be
12728	suitable 
12730	Extremely suitable 
12731	On the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge
12732	is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the
12733	others for gain or fame 
12735	Far less 
12736	 Lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly
12737	apply to that part of the soul 
12739	Certainly 
12740	One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in
12741	others as may happen 
12743	Yes 
12744	Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men
12745	 lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
12747	Exactly 
12748	And there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
12750	Very true 
12751	Now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn
12752	which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his
12753	own and depreciating that of others the money maker will contrast
12754	the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the
12755	solid advantages of gold and silver 
12757	True he said 
12758	And the lover of honour what will be his opinion Will he not think
12759	that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning 
12760	if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
12762	Very true 
12763	And are we to suppose I said that the philosopher sets any value
12764	on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the
12765	truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed
12766	from the heaven of pleasure Does he not call the other pleasures
12767	necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them 
12768	he would rather not have them 
12770	There can be no doubt of that he replied 
12771	Since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are
12772	in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable 
12773	or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how
12774	shall we know who speaks truly 
12776	I cannot myself tell he said 
12777	Well but what ought to be the criterion Is any better than experience
12778	and wisdom and reason 
12780	There cannot be a better he said 
12781	Then I said reflect Of the three individuals which has the greatest
12782	experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated Has the lover
12783	of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience
12784	of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure
12785	of gain 
12787	The philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has
12788	of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his
12789	childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has
12790	not of necessity tasted or I should rather say even had he desired 
12791	could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
12793	Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain 
12794	for he has a double experience 
12796	Yes very great 
12797	Again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the
12798	lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
12800	Nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain
12801	their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man
12802	alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour
12803	they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight
12804	which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the
12805	philosopher only 
12807	His experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
12809	Far better 
12810	And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
12812	Certainly 
12813	Further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
12814	possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
12816	What faculty 
12817	Reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
12819	Yes 
12820	And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
12821	Certainly 
12822	If wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of
12823	the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
12825	Assuredly 
12826	Or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of
12827	the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
12829	Clearly 
12830	But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
12832	The only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are
12833	approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
12835	And so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent
12836	part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us
12837	in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
12839	Unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he
12840	approves of his own life 
12842	And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the
12843	pleasure which is next 
12845	Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to
12846	himself than the money maker 
12848	Last comes the lover of gain 
12849	Very true he said 
12850	Twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust
12851	in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated
12852	to Olympian Zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure
12853	except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a
12854	shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive
12855	of falls 
12857	Yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
12858	I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
12860	Proceed 
12861	Say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
12862	True 
12863	And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
12865	There is 
12866	A state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about
12867	either that is what you mean 
12869	Yes 
12870	You remember what people say when they are sick 
12871	What do they say 
12872	That after all nothing is pleasanter than health But then they never
12873	knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
12875	Yes I know he said 
12876	And when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard
12877	them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their
12878	pain 
12880	I have 
12881	And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest
12882	and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled
12883	by them as the greatest pleasure 
12885	Yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be
12886	at rest 
12888	Again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be
12889	painful 
12891	Doubtless he said 
12892	Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also
12893	be pain 
12895	So it would seem 
12896	But can that which is neither become both 
12897	I should say not 
12898	And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
12900	Yes 
12901	But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion 
12902	and in a mean between them 
12904	Yes 
12905	How then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is
12906	pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
12908	Impossible 
12909	This then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say 
12910	the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful 
12911	and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations 
12912	when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of
12913	imposition 
12915	That is the inference 
12916	Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains
12917	and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that
12918	pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
12920	What are they he said and where shall I find them 
12921	There are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell 
12922	which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a
12923	moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
12925	Most true he said 
12926	Let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the
12927	cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
12929	No 
12930	Still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul
12931	through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of
12932	pain 
12934	That is true 
12935	And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like
12936	nature 
12938	Yes 
12939	Shall I give you an illustration of them 
12940	Let me hear 
12941	You would allow I said that there is in nature an upper and lower
12942	and middle region 
12944	I should 
12945	And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would
12946	he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the
12947	middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already
12948	in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
12950	To be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
12951	But if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine 
12952	that he was descending 
12954	No doubt 
12955	All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle
12956	and lower regions 
12958	Yes 
12959	Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth 
12960	as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have
12961	wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so
12962	that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel
12963	pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like
12964	manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state 
12965	they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and
12966	pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with
12967	the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead
12968	of white can you wonder I say at this 
12970	No indeed I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
12972	Look at the matter thus Hunger thirst and the like are inanitions
12973	of the bodily state 
12975	Yes 
12976	And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
12977	True 
12978	And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
12980	Certainly 
12981	And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
12982	which has more existence the truer 
12984	Clearly from that which has more 
12985	What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
12986	judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds
12987	of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion
12988	and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue Put
12989	the question in this way Which has a more pure being that which
12990	is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and
12991	is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is
12992	concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself
12993	variable and mortal 
12995	Far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with
12996	the invariable 
12998	And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the
12999	same degree as of essence 
13001	Yes of knowledge in the same degree 
13002	And of truth in the same degree 
13003	Yes 
13004	And conversely that which has less of truth will also have less
13005	of essence 
13007	Necessarily 
13008	Then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of
13009	the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the
13010	service of the soul 
13012	Far less 
13013	And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
13015	Yes 
13016	What is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real
13017	existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less
13018	real existence and is less real 
13020	Of course 
13021	And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according
13022	to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will
13023	more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates
13024	in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will
13025	participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
13027	Unquestionably 
13028	Those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with
13029	gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean 
13030	and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never
13031	pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do
13032	they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true
13033	being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure Like cattle 
13034	with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the
13035	earth that is to the dining table they fatten and feed and breed 
13036	and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt
13037	at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they
13038	kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust For they fill
13039	themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves
13040	which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
13042	Verily Socrates said Glaucon you describe the life of the many
13043	like an oracle 
13045	Their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise 
13046	For they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured
13047	by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant
13048	in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought
13049	about as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow
13050	of Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth 
13052	Something of that sort must inevitably happen 
13053	And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element
13054	of the soul Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into
13055	action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious 
13056	or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking
13057	to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
13058	reason or sense 
13060	Yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
13062	Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour 
13063	when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company
13064	of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which
13065	wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest
13066	degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth 
13067	and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that
13068	which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
13070	Yes certainly the best is the most natural 
13071	And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there
13072	is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their
13073	own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of
13074	which they are capable 
13076	Exactly 
13077	But when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in
13078	attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a
13079	pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
13081	True 
13082	And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy
13083	and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
13085	Yes 
13086	And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance
13087	from law and order 
13089	Clearly 
13090	And the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest
13091	distance Yes 
13093	And the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
13094	Yes 
13095	Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural
13096	pleasure and the king at the least 
13098	Certainly 
13099	But if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most
13100	pleasantly 
13102	Inevitably 
13103	Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
13105	Will you tell me 
13106	There appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious 
13107	now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious 
13108	he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his
13109	abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the
13110	measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
13112	How do you mean 
13113	I assume I said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch 
13114	the democrat was in the middle 
13116	Yes 
13117	And if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an
13118	image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure
13119	of the oligarch 
13121	He will 
13122	And the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal
13123	and aristocratical 
13125	Yes he is third 
13126	Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number
13127	which is three times three 
13129	Manifestly 
13130	The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of
13131	length will be a plane figure 
13133	Certainly 
13134	And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no
13135	difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant
13136	is parted from the king 
13138	Yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
13139	Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval
13140	by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure 
13141	he will find him when the multiplication is complete living 729
13142	times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same
13143	interval 
13145	What a wonderful calculation And how enormous is the distance which
13146	separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
13148	Yet a true calculation I said and a number which nearly concerns
13149	human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and
13150	months and years 
13152	Yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
13154	Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the
13155	evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety
13156	of life and in beauty and virtue 
13158	Immeasurably greater 
13159	Well I said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument 
13160	we may revert to the words which brought us hither Was not some one
13161	saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed
13162	to be just 
13164	Yes that was said 
13165	Now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice 
13166	let us have a little conversation with him 
13168	What shall we say to him 
13169	Let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented
13170	before his eyes 
13172	Of what sort 
13173	An ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient
13174	mythology such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus and there are
13175	many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow
13176	into one 
13178	There are said of have been such unions 
13179	Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous many headed monster 
13180	having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which
13181	he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
13183	You suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more
13184	pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model
13185	as you propose 
13187	Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third
13188	of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller
13189	than the second 
13191	That he said is an easier task and I have made them as you say 
13193	And now join them and let the three grow into one 
13194	That has been accomplished 
13195	Next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man 
13196	so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer
13197	hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature I have
13198	done so he said 
13200	And now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human
13201	creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that 
13202	if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous
13203	monster and strengthen the lion and the lion like qualities but to
13204	starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged
13205	about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt
13206	to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather
13207	to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
13209	Certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
13211	To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so
13212	speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the
13213	most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
13215	He should watch over the many headed monster like a good husbandman 
13216	fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the
13217	wild ones from growing he should be making the lion heart his ally 
13218	and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts
13219	with one another and with himself 
13221	Yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
13223	And so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage 
13224	the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover
13225	is wrong and false and ignorant 
13227	Yes from every point of view 
13228	Come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally
13229	in error Sweet Sir we will say to him what think you of things
13230	esteemed noble and ignoble Is not the noble that which subjects the
13231	beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that
13232	which subjects the man to the beast He can hardly avoid saying yes
13233	 can he now 
13235	Not if he has any regard for my opinion 
13236	But if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question 
13237	 Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the
13238	condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst 
13239	Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery
13240	for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and
13241	evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which
13242	he received And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff
13243	who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most
13244	godless and detestable Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of
13245	her husband s life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a
13246	worse ruin 
13248	Yes said Glaucon far worse I will answer for him 
13249	Has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge
13250	multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
13252	Clearly 
13253	And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent
13254	element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
13256	Yes 
13257	And luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken
13258	this same creature and make a coward of him 
13260	Very true 
13261	And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates
13262	the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money 
13263	of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his
13264	youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become
13265	a monkey 
13267	True he said 
13268	And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because
13269	they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual
13270	is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them 
13271	and his great study is how to flatter them 
13273	Such appears to be the reason 
13274	And therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that
13275	of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in
13276	whom the Divine rules not as Thrasymachus supposed to the injury
13277	of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine
13278	wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an
13279	external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible 
13280	under the same government friends and equals 
13282	True he said 
13283	And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is
13284	the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which
13285	we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until
13286	we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution
13287	of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up
13288	in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is
13289	done they may go their ways 
13291	Yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
13292	From what point of view then and on what ground can we say that
13293	a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness 
13294	which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power
13295	by his wickedness 
13297	From no point of view at all 
13298	What shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished 
13299	He who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and
13300	punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized 
13301	the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected
13302	and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom 
13303	more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength
13304	and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the
13305	body 
13307	Certainly he said 
13308	To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies
13309	of his life And in the first place he will honour studies which
13310	impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
13312	Clearly he said 
13313	In the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training 
13314	and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures 
13315	that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first
13316	object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he
13317	is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so
13318	to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
13320	Certainly he will if he has true music in him 
13321	And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and
13322	harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be
13323	dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to
13324	his own infinite harm 
13326	Certainly not he said 
13327	He will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no
13328	disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity
13329	or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property
13330	and gain or spend according to his means 
13332	Very true 
13333	And for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours
13334	as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private
13335	or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
13337	Then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
13339	By the dog of Egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly
13340	will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have
13341	a divine call 
13343	I understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which
13344	we are the founders and which exists in idea only for I do not believe
13345	that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
13347	In heaven I replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks 
13348	which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house
13349	in order But whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact 
13350	is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having
13351	nothing to do with any other 
13353	I think so he said

13357	BOOK X
13359	Socrates GLAUCON 
13361	Of he many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State 
13362	there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule
13363	about poetry 
13365	To what do you refer 
13366	To the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to
13367	be received as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul
13368	have been distinguished 
13370	What do you mean 
13371	Speaking in confidence for I should not like to have my words repeated
13372	to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but I do not
13373	mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
13374	understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true
13375	nature is the only antidote to them 
13377	Explain the purport of your remark 
13378	Well I will tell you although I have always from my earliest youth
13379	had an awe and love of Homer which even now makes the words falter
13380	on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of
13381	that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more
13382	than the truth and therefore I will speak out 
13384	Very good he said 
13385	Listen to me then or rather answer me 
13386	Put your question 
13387	Can you tell me what imitation is for I really do not know 
13389	A likely thing then that I should know 
13390	Why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the
13391	keener 
13393	Very true he said but in your presence even if I had any faint
13394	notion I could not muster courage to utter it Will you enquire yourself 
13396	Well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner Whenever
13397	a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have
13398	also a corresponding idea or form Do you understand me 
13400	I do 
13401	Let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the
13402	world plenty of them are there not 
13404	Yes 
13405	But there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a
13406	bed the other of a table 
13408	True 
13409	And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for
13410	our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking
13411	in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves 
13412	how could he 
13414	Impossible 
13415	And there is another artist I should like to know what you would
13416	say of him 
13418	Who is he 
13419	One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
13421	What an extraordinary man 
13422	Wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so For
13423	this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but
13424	plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven 
13425	and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the
13426	gods also 
13428	He must be a wizard and no mistake 
13429	Oh you are incredulous are you Do you mean that there is no such
13430	maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all
13431	these things but in another not Do you see that there is a way in
13432	which you could make them all yourself 
13434	What way 
13435	An easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat
13436	might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of
13437	turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the
13438	sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals
13439	and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking 
13440	in the mirror 
13442	Yes he said but they would be appearances only 
13443	Very good I said you are coming to the point now And the painter
13444	too is as I conceive just such another a creator of appearances 
13445	is he not 
13447	Of course 
13448	But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue And
13449	yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
13451	Yes he said but not a real bed 
13452	And what of the maker of the bed Were you not saying that he too
13453	makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of
13454	the bed but only a particular bed 
13456	Yes I did 
13457	Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence 
13458	but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that
13459	the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real
13460	existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
13462	At any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking
13463	the truth 
13465	No wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of
13466	truth 
13468	No wonder 
13469	Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire
13470	who this imitator is 
13472	If you please 
13473	Well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made
13474	by God as I think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
13476	No 
13477	There is another which is the work of the carpenter 
13478	Yes 
13479	And the work of the painter is a third 
13480	Yes 
13481	Beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend
13482	them God the maker of the bed and the painter 
13484	Yes there are three of them 
13485	God whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature
13486	and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor
13487	ever will be made by God 
13489	Why is that 
13490	Because even if He had made but two a third would still appear behind
13491	them which both of them would have for their idea and that would
13492	be the ideal bed and the two others 
13494	Very true he said 
13495	God knew this and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed 
13496	not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore He created
13497	a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
13499	So we believe 
13500	Shall we then speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the
13501	bed 
13503	Yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He
13504	is the author of this and of all other things 
13506	And what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker
13507	of the bed 
13509	Yes 
13510	But would you call the painter a creator and maker 
13511	Certainly not 
13512	Yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
13514	I think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator
13515	of that which the others make 
13517	Good I said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature
13518	an imitator 
13520	Certainly he said 
13521	And the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other
13522	imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
13524	That appears to be so 
13525	Then about the imitator we are agreed And what about the painter 
13526	 I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which
13527	originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
13529	The latter 
13530	As they are or as they appear You have still to determine this 
13532	What do you mean 
13533	I mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view 
13534	obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed
13535	will appear different but there is no difference in reality And
13536	the same of all things 
13538	Yes he said the difference is only apparent 
13539	Now let me ask you another question Which is the art of painting
13540	designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear
13541	 of appearance or of reality 
13543	Of appearance 
13544	Then the imitator I said is a long way off the truth and can do
13545	all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and
13546	that part an image For example A painter will paint a cobbler carpenter 
13547	or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if
13548	he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when
13549	he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they
13550	will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
13552	Certainly 
13553	And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all
13554	the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single
13555	thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever
13556	tells us this I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature
13557	who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he
13558	met and whom he thought all knowing because he himself was unable
13559	to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
13561	Most true 
13562	And so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and Homer 
13563	who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue
13564	as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot
13565	compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not
13566	this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here
13567	also there may not be a similar illusion Perhaps they may have come
13568	across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered
13569	when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed
13570	from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of
13571	the truth because they are appearances only and not realities Or 
13572	after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the
13573	things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
13575	The question he said should by all means be considered 
13577	Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original
13578	as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the image making
13579	branch Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his
13580	life as if he had nothing higher in him 
13582	I should say not 
13583	The real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested
13584	in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials
13585	of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of
13586	encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
13588	Yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour
13589	and profit 
13591	Then I said we must put a question to Homer not about medicine 
13592	or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we
13593	are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured
13594	patients like Asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such
13595	as the Asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and
13596	other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting
13597	military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and
13598	noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them 
13599	 Friend Homer then we say to him if you are only in the second
13600	remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third
13601	 not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern
13602	what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life 
13603	tell us what State was ever better governed by your help The good
13604	order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus and many other cities great
13605	and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that
13606	you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good 
13607	Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas and there is Solon who is renowned
13608	among us but what city has anything to say about you Is there any
13609	city which he might name 
13611	I think not said Glaucon not even the Homerids themselves pretend
13612	that he was a legislator 
13614	Well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully
13615	by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
13617	There is not 
13618	Or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human
13619	life such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian and
13620	other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
13622	There is absolutely nothing of the kind 
13623	But if Homer never did any public service was he privately a guide
13624	or teacher of any Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate
13625	with him and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life 
13626	such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for
13627	his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for
13628	the order which was named after him 
13630	Nothing of the kind is recorded of him For surely Socrates Creophylus 
13631	the companion of Homer that child of flesh whose name always makes
13632	us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as
13633	is said Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own
13634	day when he was alive 
13636	Yes I replied that is the tradition But can you imagine Glaucon 
13637	that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind
13638	 if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can
13639	you imagine I say that he would not have had many followers and
13640	been honoured and loved by them Protagoras of Abdera and Prodicus
13641	of Ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries 
13642	 You will never be able to manage either your own house or your own
13643	State until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and
13644	this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them
13645	love them that their companions all but carry them about on their
13646	shoulders And is it conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer 
13647	or again of Hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about
13648	as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous 
13649	Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold 
13650	and have compelled them to stay at home with them Or if the master
13651	would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere 
13652	until they had got education enough 
13654	Yes Socrates that I think is quite true 
13655	Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning
13656	with Homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the
13657	like but the truth they never reach The poet is like a painter who 
13658	as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though
13659	he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough
13660	for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours
13661	and figures 
13663	Quite so 
13664	In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to
13665	lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their
13666	nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant
13667	as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks
13668	of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre
13669	and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence
13670	which melody and rhythm by nature have And I think that you must
13671	have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of
13672	poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them 
13673	and recited in simple prose 
13675	Yes he said 
13676	They are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming 
13677	and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
13679	Exactly 
13680	Here is another point The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing
13681	of true existence he knows appearances only Am I not right 
13683	Yes 
13684	Then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with
13685	half an explanation 
13687	Proceed 
13688	Of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint
13689	a bit 
13691	Yes 
13692	And the worker in leather and brass will make them 
13693	Certainly 
13694	But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins Nay 
13695	hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the
13696	horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
13698	Most true 
13699	And may we not say the same of all things 
13700	What 
13701	That there are three arts which are concerned with all things one
13702	which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
13704	Yes 
13705	And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate
13706	or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for
13707	which nature or the artist has intended them 
13709	True 
13710	Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and
13711	he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop
13712	themselves in use for example the flute player will tell the flute maker
13713	which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell
13714	him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
13716	Of course 
13717	The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness
13718	and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do
13719	what he is told by him 
13721	True 
13722	The instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of
13723	it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will
13724	gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to
13725	hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
13727	True 
13728	But will the imitator have either Will he know from use whether or
13729	no his drawing is correct or beautiful Or will he have right opinion
13730	from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives
13731	him instructions about what he should draw 
13733	Neither 
13734	Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge
13735	about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
13737	I suppose not 
13738	The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence
13739	about his own creations 
13741	Nay very much the reverse 
13742	And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
13743	good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which
13744	appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
13746	Just so 
13747	Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge
13748	worth mentioning of what he imitates Imitation is only a kind of
13749	play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic
13750	or in Heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
13752	Very true 
13753	And now tell me I conjure you has not imitation been shown by us
13754	to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
13756	Certainly 
13757	And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
13759	What do you mean 
13760	I will explain The body which is large when seen near appears small
13761	when seen at a distance 
13763	True 
13764	And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water 
13765	and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing
13766	to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable Thus every
13767	sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness
13768	of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by
13769	light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect
13770	upon us like magic 
13772	True 
13773	And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue
13774	of the human understanding there is the beauty of them and the apparent
13775	greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over
13776	us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
13778	Most true 
13779	And this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational
13780	principle in the soul 
13782	To be sure 
13783	And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are
13784	equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs
13785	an apparent contradiction 
13787	True 
13788	But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty
13789	cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
13791	Very true 
13792	Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure
13793	is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with
13794	measure 
13796	True 
13797	And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts
13798	to measure and calculation 
13800	Certainly 
13801	And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles
13802	of the soul 
13804	No doubt 
13805	This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said
13806	that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their
13807	own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and
13808	friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed
13809	from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
13811	Exactly 
13812	The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has
13813	inferior offspring 
13815	Very true 
13816	And is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing
13817	also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
13819	Probably the same would be true of poetry 
13820	Do not rely I said on a probability derived from the analogy of
13821	painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with
13822	which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
13824	By all means 
13825	We may state the question thus Imitation imitates the actions of
13826	men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine 
13827	a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly 
13828	Is there anything more 
13830	No there is nothing else 
13831	But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with
13832	himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion
13833	and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also
13834	is there not strife and inconsistency in his life Though I need hardly
13835	raise the question again for I remember that all this has been already
13836	admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these
13837	and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
13839	And we were right he said 
13840	Yes I said thus far we were right but there was an omission which
13841	must now be supplied 
13843	What was the omission 
13844	Were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose
13845	his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the
13846	loss with more equanimity than another 
13848	Yes 
13849	But will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot
13850	help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
13852	The latter he said is the truer statement 
13853	Tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
13854	sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
13856	It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
13858	When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things
13859	which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
13861	True 
13862	There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist 
13863	as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge
13864	his sorrow 
13866	True 
13867	But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the
13868	same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct
13869	principles in him 
13871	Certainly 
13872	One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
13873	How do you mean 
13874	The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and
13875	that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing
13876	whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience 
13877	also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands
13878	in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
13880	What is most required he asked 
13881	That we should take counsel about what has happened and when the
13882	dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems
13883	best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the
13884	part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming
13885	the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly
13886	and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
13888	Yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
13890	Yes I said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion
13891	of reason 
13893	Clearly 
13894	And the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our
13895	troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we
13896	may call irrational useless and cowardly 
13898	Indeed we may 
13899	And does not the latter I mean the rebellious principle furnish
13900	a great variety of materials for imitation Whereas the wise and calm
13901	temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or
13902	to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when
13903	a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre For the feeling represented
13904	is one to which they are strangers 
13906	Certainly 
13907	Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature
13908	made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle
13909	in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper 
13910	which is easily imitated 
13912	Clearly 
13913	And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter 
13914	for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have
13915	an inferior degree of truth in this I say he is like him and
13916	he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the
13917	soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into
13918	a well ordered State because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens
13919	the feelings and impairs the reason As in a city when the evil are
13920	permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so
13921	in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an
13922	evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has
13923	no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one
13924	time great and at another small he is a manufacturer of images and
13925	is very far removed from the truth 
13927	Exactly 
13928	But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation 
13929	 the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are
13930	very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
13932	Yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
13933	Hear and judge The best of us as I conceive when we listen to a
13934	passage of Homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents
13935	some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration 
13936	or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight
13937	in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of
13938	the poet who stirs our feelings most 
13940	Yes of course I know 
13941	But when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe
13942	that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be
13943	quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted
13944	us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
13946	Very true he said 
13947	Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing
13948	that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his
13949	own person 
13951	No he said that is certainly not reasonable 
13952	Nay I said quite reasonable from one point of view 
13953	What point of view 
13954	If you consider I said that when in misfortune we feel a natural
13955	hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation 
13956	and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities
13957	is satisfied and delighted by the poets the better nature in each
13958	of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows
13959	the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another s 
13960	and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself
13961	in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good
13962	man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the
13963	pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this
13964	and the poem too Few persons ever reflect as I should imagine that
13965	from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves 
13966	And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight
13967	of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
13969	How very true 
13970	And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous There are jests
13971	which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic
13972	stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused
13973	by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the
13974	case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which
13975	is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by
13976	reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now
13977	let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre 
13978	you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic
13979	poet at home 
13981	Quite true he said 
13982	And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections 
13983	of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable
13984	from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions
13985	instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought
13986	to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and
13987	virtue 
13989	I cannot deny it 
13990	Therefore Glaucon I said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists
13991	of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas and that
13992	he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things 
13993	and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him
13994	and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour
13995	those who say these things they are excellent people as far as
13996	their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is
13997	the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain
13998	firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous
13999	men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our State 
14000	For if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either
14001	in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by
14002	common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will
14003	be the rulers in our State 
14005	That is most true he said 
14006	And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this
14007	our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment
14008	in sending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which
14009	we have described for reason constrained us But that she may impute
14010	to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there
14011	is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there
14012	are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling
14013	at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the
14014	mob of sages circumventing Zeus and the subtle thinkers who are
14015	beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient
14016	enmity between them Notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet
14017	friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove
14018	her title to exist in a well ordered State we shall be delighted to
14019	receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not
14020	on that account betray the truth I dare say Glaucon that you are
14021	as much charmed by her as I am especially when she appears in Homer 
14023	Yes indeed I am greatly charmed 
14024	Shall I propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but
14025	upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical
14026	or some other metre 
14028	Certainly 
14029	And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers
14030	of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her
14031	behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful
14032	to States and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit 
14033	for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers I mean 
14034	if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
14036	Certainly he said we shall the gainers 
14037	If her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who
14038	are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when
14039	they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must
14040	we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle 
14041	We too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of
14042	noble States has implanted in us and therefore we would have her
14043	appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make
14044	good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which
14045	we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we
14046	may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the
14047	many At all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we
14048	have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the
14049	truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city
14050	which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions
14051	and make our words his law 
14053	Yes he said I quite agree with you 
14054	Yes I said my dear Glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater
14055	than appears whether a man is to be good or bad And what will any
14056	one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power 
14057	aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
14059	Yes he said I have been convinced by the argument as I believe
14060	that any one else would have been 
14062	And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards
14063	which await virtue 
14065	What are there any greater still If there are they must be of an
14066	inconceivable greatness 
14068	Why I said what was ever great in a short time The whole period
14069	of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison
14070	with eternity 
14072	Say rather nothing he replied 
14073	And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space
14074	rather than of the whole 
14076	Of the whole certainly But why do you ask 
14077	Are you not aware I said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
14079	He looked at me in astonishment and said No by heaven And are
14080	you really prepared to maintain this 
14082	Yes I said I ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in
14083	proving it 
14085	I see a great difficulty but I should like to hear you state this
14086	argument of which you make so light 
14088	Listen then 
14089	I am attending 
14090	There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
14092	Yes he replied 
14093	Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying
14094	element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
14096	Yes 
14097	And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia
14098	is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is
14099	of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything 
14100	or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
14102	Yes he said 
14103	And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil 
14104	and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
14106	True 
14107	The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of
14108	each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that
14109	will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which
14110	is neither good nor evil 
14112	Certainly not 
14113	If then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption
14114	cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a
14115	nature there is no destruction 
14117	That may be assumed 
14118	Well I said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
14120	Yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing
14121	in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
14123	But does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let
14124	us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man 
14125	when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is
14126	an evil of the soul Take the analogy of the body The evil of the
14127	body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body 
14128	and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation
14129	through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them
14130	and so destroying them Is not this true 
14132	Yes 
14133	Consider the soul in like manner Does the injustice or other evil
14134	which exists in the soul waste and consume her Do they by attaching
14135	to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so
14136	separate her from the body 
14138	Certainly not 
14139	And yet I said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
14140	from without through affection of external evil which could not be
14141	destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
14143	It is he replied 
14144	Consider I said Glaucon that even the badness of food whether
14145	staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined
14146	to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although 
14147	if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we
14148	should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself 
14149	which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one
14150	thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another 
14151	and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall
14152	absolutely deny 
14154	Very true 
14155	And on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an
14156	evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one
14157	thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs
14158	to another 
14160	Yes he said there is reason in that 
14161	Either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted 
14162	let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put
14163	to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest
14164	pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become
14165	more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done
14166	to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed
14167	by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to 
14168	be affirmed by any man 
14170	And surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men
14171	become more unjust in consequence of death 
14173	But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the
14174	soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become
14175	more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right I suppose
14176	that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust 
14177	and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent
14178	power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or
14179	later but in quite another way from that in which at present the
14180	wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their
14181	deeds 
14183	Nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will
14184	not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil 
14185	But I rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice
14186	which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer
14187	alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her dwelling place
14188	from being a house of death 
14190	True I said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is
14191	unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed
14192	to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything
14193	else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
14195	Yes that can hardly be 
14196	But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent
14197	or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be
14198	immortal 
14200	Certainly 
14201	That is the conclusion I said and if a true conclusion then the
14202	souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will
14203	not diminish in number Neither will they increase for the increase
14204	of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things
14205	would thus end in immortality 
14207	Very true 
14208	But this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than
14209	we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety
14210	and difference and dissimilarity 
14212	What do you mean he said 
14213	The soul I said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest
14214	of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
14216	Certainly not 
14217	Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there
14218	are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we
14219	now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries 
14220	you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity 
14221	and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and
14222	all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly 
14223	Thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at
14224	present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a
14225	condition which may be compared to that of the sea god Glaucus whose
14226	original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members
14227	are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of
14228	ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells
14229	and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his
14230	own natural form And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition 
14231	disfigured by ten thousand ills But not there Glaucon not there
14232	must we look 
14234	Where then 
14235	At her love of wisdom Let us see whom she affects and what society
14236	and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal
14237	and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly
14238	following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out
14239	of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and
14240	shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up
14241	around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good
14242	things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as
14243	she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her
14244	nature is Of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this
14245	present life I think that we have now said enough 
14247	True he replied 
14248	And thus I said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument 
14249	we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which 
14250	as you were saying are to be found in Homer and Hesiod but justice
14251	in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own
14252	nature Let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of Gyges
14253	or not and even if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the
14254	helmet of Hades 
14256	Very true 
14257	And now Glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how
14258	many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues
14259	procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
14261	Certainly not he said 
14262	Will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
14264	What did I borrow 
14265	The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust
14266	just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case
14267	could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission
14268	ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure
14269	justice might be weighed against pure injustice Do you remember 
14271	I should be much to blame if I had forgotten 
14272	Then as the cause is decided I demand on behalf of justice that
14273	the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge
14274	to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been
14275	shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess
14276	her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may
14277	win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives
14278	to her own 
14280	The demand he said is just 
14281	In the first place I said and this is the first thing which you
14282	will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is
14283	truly known to the gods 
14285	Granted 
14286	And if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the
14287	other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
14289	True 
14290	And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all
14291	things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary
14292	consequence of former sins 
14294	Certainly 
14295	Then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is
14296	in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things
14297	will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for
14298	the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and
14299	to be like God as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the
14300	pursuit of virtue 
14302	Yes he said if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by
14303	him 
14305	And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
14306	Certainly 
14307	Such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
14309	That is my conviction 
14310	And what do they receive of men Look at things as they really are 
14311	and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners 
14312	who run well from the starting place to the goal but not back again
14313	from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look
14314	foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders 
14315	and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives
14316	the prize and is crowned And this is the way with the just he who
14317	endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life
14318	has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
14320	True 
14321	And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which
14322	you were attributing to the fortunate unjust I shall say of them 
14323	what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they
14324	become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom
14325	they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said
14326	of the others I now say of these And on the other hand of the unjust
14327	I say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth 
14328	are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course 
14329	and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger
14330	and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for
14331	ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have
14332	their eyes burned out as you were saying And you may suppose that
14333	I have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors But will you
14334	let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
14336	Certainly he said what you say is true 
14337	These then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed
14338	upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to
14339	the other good things which justice of herself provides 
14341	Yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
14342	And yet I said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness
14343	in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and
14344	unjust after death And you ought to hear them and then both just
14345	and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which
14346	the argument owes to them 
14348	Speak he said there are few things which I would more gladly hear 
14350	Socrates 
14352	Well I said I will tell you a tale not one of the tales which Odysseus
14353	tells to the hero Alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero Er the
14354	son of Armenius a Pamphylian by birth He was slain in battle and
14355	ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already
14356	in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay 
14357	and carried away home to be buried And on the twelfth day as he
14358	was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what
14359	he had seen in the other world He said that when his soul left the
14360	body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came
14361	to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth 
14362	they were near together and over against them were two other openings
14363	in the heaven above In the intermediate space there were judges seated 
14364	who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and
14365	had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly
14366	way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by
14367	them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore
14368	the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs He drew near 
14369	and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry
14370	the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see
14371	all that was to be heard and seen in that place Then he beheld and
14372	saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and
14373	earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings
14374	other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel 
14375	some descending out of heaven clean and bright And arriving ever
14376	and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went
14377	forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival 
14378	and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which
14379	came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the
14380	souls which came from heaven about the things beneath And they told
14381	one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping
14382	and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured
14383	and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted
14384	a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly
14385	delights and visions of inconceivable beauty The Story Glaucon 
14386	would take too long to tell but the sum was this He said that
14387	for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold 
14388	or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length
14389	of man s life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand
14390	years If for example there were any who had been the cause of many
14391	deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty
14392	of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they
14393	received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence
14394	and justice and holiness were in the same proportion I need hardly
14395	repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon
14396	as they were born Of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of
14397	murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he
14398	described He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits
14399	asked another Where is Ardiaeus the Great Now this Ardiaeus lived
14400	a thousand years before the time of Er he had been the tyrant of
14401	some city of Pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder
14402	brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes 
14403	The answer of the other spirit was He comes not hither and will
14404	never come And this said he was one of the dreadful sights which
14405	we ourselves witnessed We were at the mouth of the cavern and having
14406	completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden
14407	Ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and
14408	there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been
14409	great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return
14410	into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave
14411	a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had
14412	not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men
14413	of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized
14414	and carried them off and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and
14415	foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges 
14416	and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns
14417	like wool and declaring to the passers by what were their crimes 
14418	and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell And of
14419	all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was
14420	none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest
14421	they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one
14422	they ascended with exceeding joy These said Er were the penalties
14423	and retributions and there were blessings as great 
14425	Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days 
14426	on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and 
14427	on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they
14428	could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending
14429	right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling
14430	the rainbow only brighter and purer another day s journey brought
14431	them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw
14432	the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light
14433	is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe 
14434	like the under girders of a trireme From these ends is extended the
14435	spindle of Necessity on which all the revolutions turn The shaft
14436	and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made
14437	partly of steel and also partly of other materials Now the whorl
14438	is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it
14439	implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped
14440	out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and
14441	another and four others making eight in all like vessels which
14442	fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side 
14443	and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl This
14444	is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre
14445	of the eighth The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest 
14446	and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions
14447	 the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth 
14448	then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the
14449	third is seventh last and eighth comes the second The largest of
14450	fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the
14451	eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the
14452	second and fifth Saturn and Mercury are in colour like one another 
14453	and yellower than the preceding the third Venus has the whitest
14454	light the fourth Mars is reddish the sixth Jupiter is in whiteness
14455	second Now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole
14456	revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in
14457	the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness
14458	are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness
14459	appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the
14460	fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth The spindle
14461	turns on the knees of Necessity and on the upper surface of each
14462	circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone
14463	or note The eight together form one harmony and round about at
14464	equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting
14465	upon her throne these are the Fates daughters of Necessity who
14466	are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads Lachesis
14467	and Clotho and Atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony
14468	of the sirens Lachesis singing of the past Clotho of the present 
14469	Atropos of the future Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch
14470	of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl
14471	or spindle and Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the
14472	inner ones and Lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with
14473	one hand and then with the other 
14475	When Er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to Lachesis 
14476	but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order 
14477	then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives 
14478	and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows Hear the word
14479	of Lachesis the daughter of Necessity Mortal souls behold a new
14480	cycle of life and mortality Your genius will not be allotted to you 
14481	but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have
14482	the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny 
14483	Virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have
14484	more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser God
14485	is justified When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots
14486	indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which
14487	fell near him all but Er himself he was not allowed and each as
14488	he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained Then the
14489	Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives 
14490	and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were
14491	of all sorts There were lives of every animal and of man in every
14492	condition And there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the
14493	tyrant s life others which broke off in the middle and came to an
14494	end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous
14495	men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for
14496	their strength and success in games or again for their birth and
14497	the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of
14498	famous for the opposite qualities And of women likewise there was
14499	not however any definite character them because the soul when
14500	choosing a new life must of necessity become different But there
14501	was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and
14502	also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health 
14503	and there were mean states also And here my dear Glaucon is the
14504	supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should
14505	be taken Let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and
14506	seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to
14507	learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern
14508	between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the
14509	better life as he has opportunity He should consider the bearing
14510	of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively
14511	upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined
14512	with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good
14513	and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public
14514	station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and
14515	of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will
14516	then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of
14517	all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better
14518	and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of
14519	evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to
14520	the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard 
14521	For we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life
14522	and after death A man must take with him into the world below an
14523	adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled
14524	by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming
14525	upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to
14526	others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose
14527	the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible 
14528	not only in this life but in all that which is to come For this is
14529	the way of happiness 
14531	And according to the report of the messenger from the other world
14532	this was what the prophet said at the time Even for the last comer 
14533	if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed
14534	a happy and not undesirable existence Let not him who chooses first
14535	be careless and let not the last despair And when he had spoken 
14536	he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the
14537	greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality 
14538	he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not
14539	at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour
14540	his own children But when he had time to reflect and saw what was
14541	in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice 
14542	forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing
14543	the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the
14544	gods and everything rather than himself Now he was one of those
14545	who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a well ordered
14546	State but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy 
14547	And it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater
14548	number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been
14549	schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having
14550	themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to
14551	choose And owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because
14552	the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for
14553	an evil or an evil for a good For if a man had always on his arrival
14554	in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy 
14555	and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might 
14556	as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to
14557	another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground 
14558	would be smooth and heavenly Most curious he said was the spectacle
14559	 sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in
14560	most cases based on their experience of a previous life There he
14561	saw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan
14562	out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because
14563	they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing
14564	the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan
14565	and other musicians wanting to be men The soul which obtained the
14566	twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of Ajax
14567	the son of Telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice
14568	which was done him the judgment about the arms The next was Agamemnon 
14569	who took the life of an eagle because like Ajax he hated human
14570	nature by reason of his sufferings About the middle came the lot
14571	of Atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable
14572	to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of
14573	Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning
14574	in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the
14575	jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey There came also
14576	the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened
14577	to be the last of them all Now the recollection of former tolls had
14578	disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable
14579	time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had
14580	some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been
14581	neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would
14582	have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he
14583	was delighted to have it And not only did men pass into animals 
14584	but I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who
14585	changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the
14586	good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of
14587	combinations 
14589	All the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order
14590	of their choice to Lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they
14591	had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller
14592	of the choice this genius led the souls first to Clotho and drew
14593	them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus
14594	ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to
14595	this carried them to Atropos who spun the threads and made them
14596	irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the
14597	throne of Necessity and when they had all passed they marched on
14598	in a scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness which was a barren
14599	waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they
14600	encamped by the river of Unmindfulness whose water no vessel can
14601	hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and
14602	those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary 
14603	and each one as he drank forgot all things Now after they had gone
14604	to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and
14605	earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all
14606	manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting He himself was
14607	hindered from drinking the water But in what manner or by what means
14608	he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking
14609	suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
14611	And thus Glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and
14612	will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass
14613	safely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled 
14614	Wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way
14615	and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul
14616	is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of
14617	evil Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both
14618	while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go
14619	round to gather gifts we receive our reward And it shall be well
14620	with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years
14621	which we have been describing
